However, the calendar doesn't lie, and the end of August will mark the day in 2006 when I reunited with my wife, Christina, on the steps in front of my unit's barracks in Camp Pendleton, Calif.

I see those didn't die out while I was gone.\"", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Weekend Video: Pearlstine on Dow Jones", "kicker": "DealBook"}, "snippet": "The Bancroft family may be warming to the idea of a sale, but it is still far from certain that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, or any other buyer, will succeed in acquiring Dow Jones.
