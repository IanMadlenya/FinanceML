He was the loving husband of Constance B. Clery for 51 years and the father of three adoring children: Howard III, Benjamin, and Jeanne. A man of great character, Howard never allowed adversity to defeat him: his many accomplishments, family and friends who love him dearly are testament to the life of a good man. May all who love him find comfort in their memories of Howard. In 1991, Dartmouth Alumni awarded Howard Clery the Class of 1953 Award commenting: ...our brightest young people, our best hope for the future of this great nation are safer and more secure because of him. Howard and Connie cofounded Security On Campus, Inc. following the brutal murder of their daughter on Lehigh Universitys campus in 1986. After the 1987 conviction of their daughters murderer, Howard and Connie devoted their lives to making college and university campuses safer places for students. They secured passage of more than 30 State and Federal Laws requiring colleges to disclose crime information and guarantee victims rights, including the Federal Jeanne Clery Act which is named in memory of their daughter. President George H. Bush honored the Clerys for their crime victims rights work in a 1990 Rose Garden ceremony, noting: their campaign to build an America where every victim of every crime is treated with the dignity and the compassion they deserve. As CEO of Rapidforms, Howard successfully built a regional printer of labels, business forms and stationery into a national direct mail company, growing the business from 25 employees and $2 million in sales (1971) to 280 employees and $40 million in sales (1987). Howard was always quick to credit his association with CSS Industries, executive colleagues and the employees of Rapidforms for the companys accomplishments. Prior to his business success at Rapidforms, Howard held executive positions at Safeguard Industries, Raytheon, and Royal McBee, beginning his career as Gillette Company's first management trainee. Howard was educated at Dartmouth College, earning a B.A. Degree in 1953 and an MBA in 1954 from the Amos Tuck Graduate School of Business Administration. He was elected Vice President of his freshman class, President of his sophomore class, and Vice President of the Student Council during his senior year. Howards years at Dartmouth not only provided an excellent education, it was the formative place where he made life-long friendships which he cherished throughout his life. Life presented many difficult challenges for Howard Clery. Born in Boston, Howards father died in 1941 when he was 11 years old. He became a very competitive athlete at Arlington High School playing varsity football when he was stricken with polio during practice in 1945. Despite a year of rehabilitation at Warm Springs, GA. he would wear a heavy steel leg brace and walk on canes for the remainder of his life. The family will receive visitors from 7:00pm to 9:00pm on Monday, January 7th at McConaghy Funeral Home, 328 West Lancaster Avenue, Ardmore, PA. A funeral mass will be held at 10am on Tuesday, January 8th in the St. Thomas of Villanova Church University Campus, Villanova, PA. Interment will follow at Calvary Cemetery, Old Gulph Rd., Conshohocken, PA.
