He leaves behind his wife, Jacqueline Pack-Johnson, and his son, Matthew Pack. He was the son of Irene Ware and the late Fred Ware. Ron was born and raised in Mobile, AL. He graduated with a degree in Business Administration from Georgia State University and began a career in banking in Atlanta, GA. In 1989 he left his position as Vice President of Special Assets Group for First Union Corporation of Georgia to begin his career in the record industry. A position at Polygram Label Group brought Ron and his family to New York in 1992. He held subsequent positions at Island, Mercury, and Motown Records. In April 2007 he left his position as Executive Vice President of Atlantic Records to join Capitol Music Group as Executive Vice President and head of Urban Music. Ron suffered from Arteritis believed to be caused from Kawasaki Disease contracted in childhood. He became aware of his condition in March 2006 after suffering a heart attack. He faced his condition head on without fear. He was an avid runner and was training for his first marathon. Ron loved his family, turkey burgers and Guinness beer, Porsche sports cars, playing golf, and his dog Lucy. In addition to his wife and son he is survived by his mother, Irene, Ausbon Johnson (father), his brothers Darryl Johnson and George Johnson (Robin), his nieces and nephews Monique Thomas (Corey), Darron Johnson, Brian Johnson, Brianna Johnson, Brittaney Johnson and his godchildren Shavara and Shane Rice.
