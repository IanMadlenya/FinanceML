Funny thing about mud, it smells exactly the same whether it's being hurled from the left or the right.That said, I do wonder whether you're right in suggesting that the Times should have forced MoveOn.org to lose the \"Betray Us\" line as a condition of publication.It's my impression that the First Amendment protects, among other things, our right to make perfect fools of ourselves, and I'm not sure The Times should be in the business of shielding political groups (or anyone else) from exposing themselves to richly justified ridicule.It would have been far better to publish the ad as submitted, while running an editorial, on the same day if possible, properly taking MoveOn.org to task for its savage characterization of an honorable soldier trying to make the best of an impossible mission.
