She was born March 9, 1928 in Queens, New York. She graduated from Queens College in 1945. She worked for the Finance Department of New York City as Director of Microcomputer Systems which she held until retirement. After retirement she continued working as a private consultant specializing in software and database management. She co-authored \"Using Microsoft Word\" in 1988. Her political and professional life began in Trinidad and Tobago. There she was an early proponent of the application and programming of system management for the Dominion Oil Company. She was also an early graduate of the \"University\" of Woodford Square, Trinidad. Returning to New York with her family she continued her professional career. Along with her professional responsibilities she pursued her two passions; Civil Rights and Women's Rights. She played key roles with C.O.R.E. and the Manhattan Women Political Caucus, particularly her ardent support of Bella Abzug. In retirement she used her unique talents in aiding various nonprofit organizations. She was inspired by the lives and works of Simone de Beauvoir, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bertrand Russell and Eric Williams. These interests and the generosity she extended to family and friends will define her and be her legacy. Her only brother Irwin Feder lives in Miami. She is survived by her husband of 54 years. Oswald Glean Chase, and son Howard, two grandsons, Philip and Michael Chase.
