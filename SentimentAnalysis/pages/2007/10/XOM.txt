Kelly died at her home in Sagaponack, New York on October 20, 2007 after a hard-fought battle with cancer. She was 57. Born in New York City, she resided in Manhattan, Los Angeles, London and Rome over the course of her lifetime. She received an MBA with a Concentration in Marketing from Columbia University Graduate School of Business and a BA Degree cum laude in History and Political Science from Fordham University. She began her career in New York at American Home Products Corp, but quickly moved on to product management and marketing for Revlon, Inc. She relocated to Los Angeles in 1981 where she worked in product management at Max Factor & Company, Carnation Company, and Vidal Sassoon. She began her foray into the entertainment business in 1990 and held marketing and promotions positions at The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, 20th Century Fox and D.L. Blair West. In 1993 she began her career at Paramount Pictures as Director, National Promotions. Two years later she was promoted to Executive Director, National Promotions and in 1998 to Vice President, Worldwide Marketing Partnerships where she remained until 2001. Most recently, Susan formed BrandFusion Marketing, a marketing agency with offices in New York and Los Angeles. Paramount Pictures, Paramount Home Entertainment and Paramount Television contracted the company to serve as a promotions agent. Susan is survived by her husband of 30 years Eugene Kelly. He is a producer currently engaged on HBO's miniseries \"The Pacific\". He will sorely miss Susan's contagious enthusiasm, gentle smile, and supportive companionship. She is also survived by her mother Albina (\"Kay\") Yannece, her sister Mary and her husband Thomas Muller; a brother Joseph Yannece and his wife Pauline; her mother-in-law Marilouise Kelly, two brothers-in-law James Kelly and Edward Kelly; four sisters-inlaw Barbara Tierney, Marilynda Vianna, Christine Weiss, and Patti Ann Kelly; and three nephews Thomas and Matthew Muller and Justin Yannece. According to the family, she was a dedicated marketing executive who loved to travel, but never forgot to stop and smell the roses and look at the clouds pass by. They will miss her infectious laughter and graceful sense of style. A memorial service will be held in Sagaponack, New York at a date to be announced.
