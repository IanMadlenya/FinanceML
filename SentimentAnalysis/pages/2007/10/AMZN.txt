The AllianceBernstein community mourns the passing, at age 59, of Jonathan Gray-our partner, colleague, friend and one of the funniest people you'd ever meet-after a courageous six-year battle with cancer. Born in Kingston, PA, Jonathan received a B.A. from Wesleyan University and an M.B.A. from New York University before joining Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc. in 1973. He remained with SCB & Co. and its successor firm, AllianceBernstein, for his entire career. Starting as a securities analyst following the savings and loan industry, Jonathan approached his research with enthusiasm and a keen intellect. He quickly made his mark, having an immediate impact on the investment decisions at Bernstein and gaining a wide following in the investment community at large. Elected to the Institutional Investor All-Star team for the first time in 1976, Jonathan was similarly honored for 29 out of 30 years-missing only in 2003, due to his illness. Over the years, he expanded his coverage to include government sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Sallie Mae), mortgage banking companies and mortgage insurers. Widely quoted in newspapers and magazines, and author of voluminous research on the industries and companies he followed, Jonathan also wrote a white paper for the FDIC titled Financial Deregulation and the Savings and Loan Crisis (1988) and testified before Congress on a variety of subjects -on the problems of savings and loans and the creation of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), on legislation concerning government-sponsored enterprises (1992), and on student loans (1998). We offer our deepest condolences to Jonathan's wife Bonnie and his sons Jordan and Zachary. We will miss Jonathan's insight, his commitment and his wit.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  McGarry, Michael J."}, "snippet": "McGARRY--Michael J., of Syosset, NY, on October 30, 2007.
