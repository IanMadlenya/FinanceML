Would he wrench apart the expected with some rhythmic displacement, smear up the perfect diagrams of his playing? Not really. But you shouldn't take Mr. Clapton out of context. Rock shows -- even those delivered by middle-aged men in running shoes -- often build up to innocent release, the sound of glass crashing. Mr. Clapton polishes the glass, endlessly refining. His guitar playing pulls itself into taut symmetries, building up to wailing high notes and then coming down. His phrases operate in a tightly circumscribed area in relation to the beat. He squeezes soul and accuracy out of his own limited voice. He is tremendously even, which can be tremendously appealing.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CLAPTON, ERIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 255, "offset": 0, "time": 60}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
