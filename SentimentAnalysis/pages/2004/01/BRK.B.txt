''Everybody but me.'' His reaction? ''This is nothing compared to the N.W.A. days or earlier in my career.'' That's putting it mildly. N.W.A., which in the late 80's defined West Coast hip-hop with layered beats and brutal lyrics, probably offended more people before breakfast than most artists do all day; the F.B.I. sent the group's record label a letter expressing its disapproval of the song ''[Expletive] Tha Police.'' After Ice Cube left the group in 1990, his solo albums, like ''Amerikkka's Most Wanted,'' became hits for their urgent beats and cinematic storytelling, as well as cultural flash points for the insults they aimed at women and gays.
