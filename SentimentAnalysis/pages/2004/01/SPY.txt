Still, on a recent arctic morning, with flurries in the air and the promise of more to come, the register was busy ringing up cups of piping hot java. Apparently some habits are hard to break, and regulars have had years to develop the habit of dropping by on the way to work. Founded in 1869, Ward's has been in Mr. Sommer's family since the 1920's. It has been situtated near City Hall for 65 years, but it seems straight out of the 19th century, with a pressed-tin ceiling, wooden barrels full of candy (20 lollipops for $1), bags of fresh-roasted peanuts ($1.79 a pound) and coffee beans spilling out of burlap bags.

I can count the number of real Long Island barbecue spots on the fingers of one hand. Smokin' Al's, though, got my heart thumping and mouth watering. We could follow our noses to this agreeable storefront. It calls itself a barbecue joint, but it's an attractive one. Sure, the wooden tables are bare, set with paper placemats and topped with a roll of paper towels, but the place has class. Exposed brick walls are home to giant paintings of cartoon pigs in sunglasses as members of a swing band. Other pigs are depicted as torch singers, waitresses and jitterbuggers. The 1930's and 40's music playing in the background is appropriate.
