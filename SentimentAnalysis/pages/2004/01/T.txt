She helped pioneer efforts to bring social work counseling and guidance into New York's most challenging public schools in Harlem and Upper Manhattan. Always gracious and interested in other people, she was a longtime supporter of liberal causes, such as Planned Parenthood, Inc. of New York and North Carolina. Carol Lipkin was the daughter of Osmond K. Fraenkel and Helene Fraenkel of New York and Westport, CT. Her father was a noted civil liberties lawyer, her mother was a playwright. She was married to Mack Lipkin, M.D., an internist and Clinical Professor of Medicine at the Cornell School of Medicine. Mack Lipkin died in 1989 in Chapel Hill, NC. She later moved to Foulkeways Retirement Community in Gwynedd, PA, and moved to Carleton Willard, Bedford, MA, in 2000, where she lived with her beloved cat, Mr. Abraham Lincoln, until her death.

The heroine of Gibson's seventh novel is Cayce Pollard, a ''coolhunter'' hired by advertisers to penetrate happening neighborhoods in search of the next big thing. An assignment to track down the creator of a mysterious series of film clips that have gained a cult following on the Net sends her from London to Tokyo; along the way, she pursues a secret quest: to find out what happened to her father, a retired C.I.A. man who vanished in New York on Sept. 11, 2001. ''Gibson nails the texture of Internet culture,'' Lisa Zeidner said here in 2003. ''Yet the book also manages to be . . . a novel of consciousness -- less science fiction than Henry James.'' FIRST GREAT TRIUMPH: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power, by Warren Zimmermann. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $15.) A career diplomat examines the decade of American expansionism that began with the Spanish-American War and ran through Theodore Roosevelt's presidency, and the lives of five men who helped create a global empire: Roosevelt, Alfred T. Mahan, Henry Cabot Lodge, John Hay and Elihu Root. In 2002 our reviewer, David Nasaw, called this a ''brilliantly readable book.'' THE RURAL LIFE, by Verlyn Klinkenborg. (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.) This collection of essays from The Times and a few other publications is organized as a month-by-month journey through the year, chronicling the seasonal demands and serendipities of life on the author's farm in upstate New York, with side trips to New England and the West. The result is ''a work of almost uninterrupted felicity,'' Rob Nixon wrote here in 2002. Klinkenborg's voice ''manages to sound both intimate . . . and consequential.'' GILLIGAN'S WAKE, by Tom Carson. (Picador, $14.) Exasperating, uneven but infused with a trashy exuberance, this pastiche of a novel looks at 20th-century American history through the lives of the castaways on ''Gilligan's Island,'' with the likes of Holden Caulfield and Jean-Paul Sartre rubbing elbows with Gilligan (or ''Gil''), the Skipper, the Professor and the rest of the crew. ''Carson's prose often has the energy of a song by his beloved Ramones,'' David Kelly wrote in the Book Review last year. ''A reference to Clare Boothe Luce can sit alongside an allusion to Nabokov and be just as meaningful, or meaningless.'' SET THIS HOUSE IN ORDER: A Romance of Souls, by Matt Ruff. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.95.) Andrew and Penny both suffer from multiple personality syndrome but manage to function as employees of a virtual-reality start-up outside Seattle. When Andrew comes undone, however, he sets off with Penny (and the 100 or so clamoring souls in his head) to his childhood home in Michigan. The result is an ''irresistible'' novel that is an ''odyssey of transformation and trust,'' Kerry Fried wrote in these pages in 2003. DRINKING COFFEE ELSEWHERE, by ZZ Packer. (Riverhead, $14.) The people in this debut collection of short stories form a constellation of young, black experience, particularly the women in several tales who struggle through layers of stereotypes and expectations to make their presence felt in the world. ''The obstacles to achieving identity are more complicated than the obvious ones, such as our grievous racial history,'' Jean Thompson wrote in these pages in 2003. Packer displays ''the old-time religion of storytelling,'' though her prose ''supplies plenty of the edge and energy we expect from contemporary fiction.'' GIRL MEETS GOD: A Memoir, by Lauren F. Winner. (Random House, $13.95.) Tracing the seismic shifts in her religious life, the author, whose father was Jewish and her mother a ''lapsed Southern Baptist,'' tells of how she made the decision as a young woman to convert from Orthodox Judaism to evangelical Christianity. This ''is a passionate and thoroughly engaging account of a continuing spiritual journey within two profoundly different faiths,'' Reeve Lindbergh wrote in the Book Review in 2002. WHEN HARLEM NEARLY KILLED KING: The 1958 Stabbing of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., by Hugh Pearson. (Seven Stories, $11.95.) In a little-known incident, a deranged Harlem woman, raging against the 29-year-old King and the N.A.A.C.P., nearly killed him with a letter opener as he sat for photographers. Pearson's account ''skillfully examines a brief but crucial moment, illuminating the unsteady beginnings of the civil rights revolution,'' Nia-Malika Henderson said here in 2002.
