Cullman 3rd, a former company Chairman Emeritus and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Philip Morris Incorporated. He was 92. A legendary figure in the history of Philip Morris, Mr. Cullman also ranks among the most important American chief executives in the generation that emerged following World War II. During his 21 years of service as chief executive from 1957 to 1978, Marlboro became one of the world's most valuable brands. At a time in the late 1950s and early 1960s when most American companies tended toward parochialism, Mr. Cullman had the vision to see opportunities outside the U.S. and helped to build a $1.8 billion international tobacco business by the time he retired. Additionally, a number of acquisitions in the consumer goods business, such as Miller Brewing Company, helped lay the groundwork for the company's successful diversification into the food business in the 1980s and 1990s. Under Mr. Cullman, the company also greatly expanded its philanthropic activities, becoming a significant contributor to the arts, among other areas. Mr. Cullman was himself a committed outdoorsman, conservationist and philanthropist, serving as chairman of the Atlantic Salmon Federation and on the board of the World Wildlife Fund. He also formed the Cullman Wildlife Project in Tanzania. In addition, Mr. Cullman served as Chairman of the U.S. Open Tennis Championship and as Chairman of the Tennis Hall of Fame. During World War II, Mr. Cullman distinguished himself as a U.S. Navy commander in the Pacific. He was awarded a Commendation Ribbon with seven stars for his service. Mr. Cullman led an extraordinary life and left behind a substantial legacy, not only in business, but in his service to his country and the numerous causes he believed in and supported. The Altria Board of Directors and employees of Altria's companies, pay warm tribute to Mr. Cullman's memory and his many accomplishments, and extend their deepest sympathy to his family. Mr. Cullman is survived by a daughter, Dorothy Cullman Treisman and his brothers, Edgar M. Cullman and Lewis B. Cullman. In addition to his daughter and brothers, Mr. Cullman is survived by two grandsons, Joel H. Treisman and Jeffrey D. Treisman; two stepchildren, Tracy Straus and Barnard S. Straus; and two greatgrandchildren.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "COMPANY BRIEFS"}, "snippet": "Marriott International Inc., Washington, the hotel chain, said its board had raised the quarterly dividend by 1 cent, to 8.5 cents a share, and approved the repurchase of up to 20 million shares.
