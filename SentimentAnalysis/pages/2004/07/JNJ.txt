From the glowing pastels, sockless loafers and stubble of ''Miami Vice'' to Tom Cruise's gray hair in ''Collateral,'' Mann has evoked a revolutionary kind of cool. He has a precise instinct for how his men want to dress and live, and that sensibility, that particular code of tough guys who know how to wear a suit, pick a perfect bottle of wine and shoot a gun, has shaped a generation. Mann is prickly about this idea -- he doesn't want his work reduced to shoes and architecture. ''What it looks like is important to me,'' he says, barely eating his lunch of Japanese soup at his office in West L.A. ''But I've worked too hard to just be known as an arbiter of taste.'' Mann, who is 61 but projects a kind of boyish intensity of interest, winces slightly. He is, more than even most directors, obsessive about his work and the universe it represents. If the conversation strays to chitchat, Mann's focus instantly turns inward, back to whatever project is currently occupying his brain. Mann's large office is decorated with mementos from his films -- photographs from ''Ali''; models of sets; a painted poster from Koreatown that was used in ''Collateral''; a stuffed, snarling bobcat that was last seen in ''Heat.'' On the set, he is famously maniacal about details. He insisted on specially designed wire-brushed hangers for a scene in ''Heat'' because he liked the look of them and wanted the hangers to make a certain noise when they banged against one another. He brought water trucks to spray down the streets of Chicago when he shot ''Thief'' because he was trying to recreate the perspective of a Pissarro. On ''Miami Vice,'' he literally painted parts of Miami Beach. ''The whole city was grim; it was beige,'' Mann says, recalling the time he went to South Beach to scout locations. ''It was full of derelict hotels, and I realized the streamlined Deco look was still there, buried under the tan paint. I wanted to show heat, and I came up with the idea of vibrating pastels.'' On ''Miami Vice,'' earth tones were banned (as was red -- Mann doesn't like red), and everything about Don Johnson's character -- from his Ferrari Daytona to his Versace T-shirt -- was customized to Mann's specifications. On his next TV show, ''Crime Story,'' set in his hometown, Chicago, in the early 60's, Mann went retro. The lead detective lived in a Mies van der Rohe apartment with late 50's Egg chairs by the Scandinavian designer Arne Jacobsen and was dressed period perfect in boxy dark suits and skinny ties. As usual, the look caught on. Mann has been known to change a character's clothing three times to get the proper effect. He can spot the wrong tie in a sea of extras and will park a boring white car next to a snazzier baby blue model to enhance the mood. ''Adding white always makes color burn a little,'' he has said. ''I got that idea from a 20th-century British painter.''", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "COLLATERAL (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MANN, MICHAEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "APPAREL"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Despite Injuries, Earnhardt Wants to Go the Distance", "kicker": "AUTO RACING"}, "snippet": "A foam seat insert has become the hottest piece of equipment on the Nascar Nextel Cup series.
