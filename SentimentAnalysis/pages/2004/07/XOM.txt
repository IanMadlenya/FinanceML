With a fortune estimated at $15 billion, Mikhail Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion and faces a 10-year jail term. His oil company, Yukos, has been hit with a tax bill of $3.4 billion, and the government is threatening to seize its most valuable assets. Although many nations, including America, tend to err on the side of courtesy to wealthy defendants, Russia does not: denied bail since his arrest in October, Khodorkovsky has not been allowed to prepare for trial from the comfort of one of his mansions, and when he is brought to court, he is placed in a metal cage. In today's Russia, wealth attracts trouble. President Vladimir Putin, eager to punish billionaires who oppose his rule, has chosen to make an example of Khodorkovsky, though Khodorkovsky is not the first to face Putin's selective wrath. Not long ago, Boris Berezovsky, a billionaire power broker in Moscow in the 1990's, chose exile in London to the metal cage that might have been his fate if he stayed in Russia. Vladimir Gusinsky, a media baron, was next up: forced to sell his empire at fire-sale prices, Gusinsky must now content himself with exile in Israel.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "PUTIN, VLADIMIR V"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KHODORKOVSKY, MIKHAIL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ALEKPEROV, VAGIT"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "RUSSIA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "LUKOIL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YUKOS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OIL (PETROLEUM) AND GASOLINE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths   GLASSMAN, DANIEL"}, "snippet": "GLASSMAN -- Daniel.
