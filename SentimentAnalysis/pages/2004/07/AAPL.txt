It was, of course, an eating holiday, but to ease the languors between breakfast on the z\u00f3calo and lunch at wherever, I arranged French conversation lessons with a likable chap named Herv\u00e9. His existence in the town was pure Magic Realism, predicated on the notion that eating Oaxacan chapulines -- fried grasshoppers -- has the same mystical someday-you-will-return effect as a coin tossed over the shoulder into the Trevi Fountain. On a youthful dare, a visiting Herv\u00e9 had downed a cricket or two a couple of blocks from the z\u00f3calo in Benito Ju\u00e1rez Market; when I met him years later, he was living in Oaxaca, still blinking with surprise, giving French classes to pass the time. He was a good guy, a Gascon (I think) with an excellent palate and a gargantuan appetite for life. All life -- marine life, plant life, mammals, arthropods, etc., preferably with butter and garlic. He considered Oaxaca a gastronomic heaven, and we bonded over his contention that mole negro oaxaque\u00f1o would be better showcased with duck, since it overpowers the hapless chicken it usually accompanies. For my formal last meal during my stay, I invited him to dine at a restaurant that specialized in regional foods dating back to before Christopher Columbus dropped anchor in the New World.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "OAXACA (MEX)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Superhero Styling: Wet Suits Go Buff", "kicker": "DRESS CODES"}, "snippet": "ON a recent Saturday morning, Lara Jensen caught a steep, peeling wave at Steamer Lane, a surf break in Santa Cruz, Calif.
