She crouched on her board, ripping down the wave's face and then cutting upward and looping around in a series of S-turns. A gaggle of onlookers, gathered behind a barrier on a nearby cliff, hooted and whistled, although at least one of them seemed more impressed by Ms. Jensen's outfit than by her spectacular ride. ''There's something about a girl in a wet suit,'' said Stephen Marks, a dentistry student from Sacramento. ''I may have to take up surfing.'' These days, surfers on beaches up and down both coasts are looking good, ''stylin' in a way they never have before,'' said Sam George, the editor of Surfer magazine in Dana Point, Calif. In the last two years, America's top manufacturers of surfing products have been making wet suits that are designed not just for warmth but also to keep the wearer looking buff and sexy.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SURFING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "APPAREL"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "State Official Had a Deal All His Own"}, "snippet": "THE state attorney general ruled last week that an official who resigned under pressure from Gov.
