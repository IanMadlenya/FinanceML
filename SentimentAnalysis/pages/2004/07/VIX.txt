Two days later, as the ship sailed the South Pacific from Hawaii to San Diego, hijacked planes flew into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and the nation went on high alert. For the first time in modern naval history, a ship went into full combat mode with hundreds of civilians, including children, on board. ''Tiger Cruise,'' a Disney Channel movie to have its premiere on Friday at 8 p.m., recounts these harrowing events through the perspectives of several civilians, or Tigers, on board. But at its heart lies the story of a Navy commander, portrayed by Bill Pullman, and his young daughter, played by Hayden Panettiere, who, frustrated by the military life that takes her father away from her for months at a time, boards his ship with the intention of persuading him to come home -- until his heroic actions in the face of tragedy help her understand what his commitment really means.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "TIGER CRUISE (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Think It's the Valuations Hurting Your Returns?
