IPOD PEOPLE -- From the University of Wisconsin to Fordham, Hamilton College to Princeton, students don't miss a beat: Their most essential item is their iPod, the pocketsize jukebox that can store up to 10,000 songs. Apple reports that it has sold 3.7 million iPods since it introduced the portable music player in October 2001; last quarter's sales were triple those of a year ago. Schools have taken note: Duke will distribute complimentary iPods to all 1,650 incoming freshmen this fall. ''Everyone has an iPod -- everyone,'' says Jan Tobias Monty, who just graduated from the University of Oregon. ''It's kind of a problem, because there are thousands of accessories, and you want all of them.'' For instance, with a microphone add-on, you can record lectures. Or say something clever to the cute international student down the hall by downloading a language translator from the Talking Panda service. Here's something free: the American Constitution Society for Law and Policy has specially formatted the United States Constitution for iPods.
