Administered by the National Trust, the house and its eight acres of gardens were opened to the public for the first time last Friday. Austere on the outside but glamorous indoors -- with its concrete walls and chandelier of Venetian-glass flowers, it's an unlikely merging of Le Corbusier and Eva Gabor -- the Homewood is the only free-standing Modernist house open to the public in Britain.
