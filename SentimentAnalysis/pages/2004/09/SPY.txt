DIXIE CARTER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. Ms. Carter, a madcap steel magnolia from Tennessee, and John Wallowitch, the venerable Manhattan composer, pianist and singer of the old school, have been friends for more than 40 years. Performing together, this odd couple conjures a poignant mirage of a less hectic Manhattan when sophistication implied nothing naughtier than an extra glass of Champagne and cocktail chatter discreetly laced with innuendo. But the rigorous vocal upkeep necessary to carry off this kind of Proustian resurrection has not been maintained. Ms. Carter's singing is frayed and badly out of condition.

Sunday at 2 p.m. Cover: $20; two-drink minimum. Mr. Officer is a font of optimism. Even when the storm clouds are dumping buckets of rain on his head, he would rather peer into the distance and discern the hazy outlines of a rainbow on the horizon. What keeps the singing of this light but steady baritone from becoming insistently cloying is his musicality and connoisseurship of songs from many decades, which he likes to weave into odd but smart combinations (e.g. Van Morrison's ''Moondance'' with Irving Berlin's ''Let Yourself Go''); Barry Levitt charges behind on piano. Also at Danny's: tonight at 7, Laura Pearson, singer; tonight and tomorrow night from 9 to 1, Jerry Scott, singer and pianist; tomorrow night at 9:30, Barbara Brussell, singer; Sunday from 8 to midnight, Scott Ailing with Ryan Hunt.

Fortunes have been made here, on the ragged peninsula where St. Michaels and its neighboring towns project out into Chesapeake Bay, since the 1600's -- in farming, trade and fishing, and now in tourism and real estate. St. Michaels escaped damage in the War of 1812 by hanging lanterns in trees outside of town, causing the British to overshoot and earning itself the nickname ''the town that fooled the British.'' Now the invaders are weekenders and vacationers. Most of the leisure crowd in the 19th-century clapboard houses come from Baltimore or Washington; one second-home owner is Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. The traditional economy has been ravaged by parasites attacking the oysters in Chesapeake Bay, but millions are being spent to try to bring the oysters back, and there's never an oyster shortage in the restaurants. STEVE BAILEY Friday 4 p.m. 1. You Want That Malted? If you're looking for a crab-themed anything, you'll find it in the shops on Talbot Street, along with T-shirts, garden sculptures and duck decoys. Stop for ice cream at Justine's (106 South Talbot Street, 410-745-5416), where they'll offer to add malt to any milkshake you can think of. 8 p.m. 2. Dinner From the Bay If you can get a table at 208 Talbot (208 North Talbot Street, 410-745-3838), join the polo-shirt-and-blazer crowd tucking into regional fare like crab cakes ($15) and more extravagant seafood dishes like cassolette of lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp and monkfish ($29.59). On Fridays you may get in without a reservation; Saturdays, when the only option is a popular fixed-price meal ($55) that includes the entire menu, can be impossible. Saturday 8 a.m. 3. Two Wheels to the Ferry Get on a bicycle, which can be rented at the St. Michaels Marina (305 Mulberry Street; 410-745-2400; $11 for a half day) and take advantage of roads so level that almost anyone can be a long-distance rider. Stop at Blue Crab Coffee (102 Fremont Street, 410-745-4155) for light breakfast fare -- not that you really need to fortify yourself for the easy one-hour 7.6-mile ride to the Oxford-Bellevue Ferry (410-745-9023). One segment where the road has no shoulder makes up for the deficiency by having very little traffic. For $5 round trip, the ferry (several trips an hour every day during daylight; closed December through February), a service here since 1683, will take you and your bike on the 10-minute crossing of the Tred Avon River to Oxford, a tiny Colonial-era town. After a spin through its serene tree-lined streets, reboard the ferry for the ride back. Noon 4. Oysters at Harborside This part of Maryland is known as the Bay Hundred -- the name comes from a Colonial division of Maryland into districts that were each required to support 100 militiamen -- and the Bay Hundred is known for seafood: softshell and hardshell crabs in summer and oysters in the fall and winter. For less than $20, you can have a lunch of oysters steamed, fried, Rockefeller or raw at one of the bustling restaurants clustered on St. Michaels Harbor (a good choice is the Town Dock Restaurant, 125 Mulberry Street, 410-745-5577) while you watch the hundreds of boats bobbing at docks or moored in the Miles River. 1 p.m. 5. The Road to Tilghman Now drive out of town the other way on Route 33, toward Tilghman Island, about 14 miles away, and keep an eye on the horizon to your right for masts and sails on the open Chesapeake, just beyond the farm fields. Make a stop in Sherwood, one of several almost invisible communities on the way, at Sherwood Antiques (in the Post Office building, 410-886-2562), an old house stuffed with centuries of furniture and furnishings, like a 19th-century Shaker rocker ($1,800) and an unusual 18th-century bench-table ($1,500) that converts from one to the other. Peer down the tree-lined lanes that lead to Georgian-style manor houses, most still private homes. 2 p.m. 6. Commodore's Log Tilghman Island itself has no manor houses, but it's fast becoming a place for vacationers. Long a working-class community centered around farming and the sea harvest, it lost many of its watermen when the oyster harvest crashed. The old Tilghman can still be seen in the island's venerable skipjacks -- the large sailboats, that are generally the only boats allowed to dredge for oysters in the bay -- based in Dogwood Harbor. Documenting the island's past and present is Gary D. Crawford, above, who with his wife, Susan, owns and operates Crawfords Nautical Books (5782 Main Street, Tilghman, on the right about a mile beyond the bridge, 410-886-2418; www.crawfordsnautical.com). The shop, in a former bank building, has 11,000 or so books, from Mr. Crawford's own works about Tilghman ($5 to $10) to a first edition of Commodore Matthew C. Perry's account of his 1850's trade mission to Japan ($3,400). Tilghman Island Day, an annual seafood festival, is Oct. 16 this year. 3 p.m. 7. The Water Beckons Get out on the water. Rent a kayak ($25 an hour) or a motorboat ($150 to $225 for up to four hours) at the Tilghman Island Marina (6140 Mariners Court, Tilghman; 410-886-2500). Pass through Knapp's Narrows, the strip of water that makes Tilghman an island, to explore expansive Harris Creek on the east or to begin a circumnavigation of the island, which is about three miles long and one mile wide. Pay attention to channel markers and to the chart that comes with the motorboats -- during low tide some areas off Tilghman are too shallow for any propeller-driven craft. Want to let someone else do the driving? The ketch Lady Patty, the converted Vietnam-era special operations vessel Sharps Island (both berthed near the drawbridge; 410-886-2215) and the 1886 skipjack Rebecca T. Ruark (Dogwood Harbor, 410-886-2176) take passengers on excursions. Watch the skies for always-present osprey and the occasional bald eagle. 6 p.m. 8. The Floating Parade Stop in at the Tilghman Island Inn (21384 Coopertown Road, Tilghman; 410-886-2141), a club-like 20-room hotel, where a band may be playing at an outdoor bar. Order a beer and watch as one boat after another returns to the narrows for the night. Stick around for dinner prepared by David McCallum, one of the inn's owners as well as its chef. ''Black eye pea cakes'' ($7.25) are a popular appetizer. Rock fish (striped bass from the Chesapeake, a regional favorite; $29.50) is pan-seared and served over lobster and crab. 9 p.m. 9. Grab a Grappa Perhaps the coziest place to end the day is back in St. Michaels in front of the fireplace at the Purser's Pub at the Inn at Perry Cabin (308 Watkins Lane, 410-745-2200). It was built in 1816, turned into an inn in 1980, purchased by Orient-Express in 1999 and expanded to 81 rooms and suites in 2003. Try one of its 6 grappas ($7 to $15), its 9 ports ($10 to $25) or its 42 Scotches ($9 to $45). Sunday 10 a.m. 10. Heaven for Boat Lovers Learn about skipjacks, push boats and bugeyes at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum (Navy Point, St. Michaels; 410-745-2916; admission $10 for adults). An 18-acre harborfront complex, it includes a relocated Chesapeake lighthouse; buildings devoted to oystering, Chesapeake history, steamboats and waterfowl; and a fleet of distinctive bay boats. One of the smaller buildings, a crab shack, has a plaque on its side showing how high the water reached last year when Hurricane Isabelle hit the area. If you start planning your next visit before you leave, keep in mind the museum's apprentice-for-a-day program, which costs $25 and involves spending a Saturday or Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., helping a shipwright restore a classic bay boat or build a new one. THE BASICS Visiting St. Michaels St. Michaels is about a four-hour drive from New York and about an hour and a half from both Baltimore and Washington, which have the closest major airports. The Inn at Perry Cabin (308 Watkins Lane; 410-745-2200) is a sprawling complex -- some parts almost 200 years old -- on the Miles River adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum. Its 81 rooms and suites are $245 to $625 on weekends. In the heart of St. Michaels, the Old Brick Inn Bed & Breakfast (401 South Talbot Street, 410-745-3323) comprises two buildings, one dating to 1816. Its 14 rooms are $115 to $350. On Tilghman Island and overlooking Dogwood Harbor and its skipjacks, the Chesapeake Wood Duck Inn (21490 Gibsontown Road at Dogwood Harbor, 410-886-2070) has six rooms and one attached cottage at $149 to $229, including a lavish breakfast.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "MARYLAND"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ST MICHAELS (MD)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MARITIME MUSEUM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AGRICULTURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTIQUES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSEUMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "THEATER GUIDE"}, "snippet": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend.

Broadway + ''DRACULA, THE MUSICAL.'' And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway. This show, which sets the familiar tale of old snaggletooth to the familiar music of Frank Wildhorn, bristles with all the animation, suspense and sex appeal of a Victorian waxworks in a seaside amusement park. Take your shots. Say something, if you must, about toothlessness or bloodlessness or the kindness of hammering stakes into the hearts of undead shows. But you may concede that it isn't much fun to trash something so eminently trashable. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' which features a book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''), isn't simply bad, which is an aesthetic state of being that is kind of fun if you're in the right mood. It is bad and boring. Among the talents wasted here are Melissa Errico, Kelli O'Hara, Stephen McKinley Henderson and, looking like a butler's butler in the title role, Tom Hewitt (2:00). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6000. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.50 to $101.25 (Ben Brantley). + ''THE FROGS.'' Even the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me can curdle every now and then. This musical adaptation of Aristophanes' 2,400-year-old comedy of gods and playwrights has the highest concentration of blue-ribbon talent of any show now on Broadway. It stars Nathan Lane, the only actor who qualifies as serious royalty in the thinning world of musical comedy, and Roger Bart, whose very smile has been known to stop a show. The director and choreographer is Susan Stroman (''The Producers,'' ''Contact''). And the composer is -- reverent pause, please -- Stephen Sondheim. Yet despite these fine ingredients, what should have been a zesty, airy souffl\u00e9 is a soggy, lumpy batter that never shows the slightest signs of rising. Staged in 1974 as a publicity-garnering, hourlong novelty by the Yale School of Drama -- around and in the university gymnasium swimming pool, if you please -- this bauble of a show has been reshaped to fill two and a half hours. The results suggest that to stretch something this slight is to shatter it (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $65 to $95 (Brantley). *+ ''I AM MY OWN WIFE'' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Mois\u00e9s Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (n\u00e9 Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show (Bruce Weber). Off Broadway ''THE BALD SOPRANO'' AND ''THE LESSON.'' Works of art have a way of regaining currency as the years pass. The Romanian-born Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, writing in 1950, surely did not envision the 21st-century American political landscape, but his ''Bald Soprano,'' a dark comedy about the vacuity of language, seems eerily apposite today. This is true despite the flaws in Carl Forsman's production, which domesticates and slightly sentimentalizes Ionesco's corrosive vision, generating plenty of silly humor but failing to penetrate to the play's icy core. In ''The Lesson,'' the problem doesn't arise, since this more macabre comedy is clear-cut, at least in its emotional dynamics. It, too, could easily be seen by the politically minded as a grim cautionary tale for today. Beneath the play's preposterous comic surfaces, Ionesco makes unsettling connections between the corruption of means of communication and the unleashing of man's basest, most violent instincts; he seems to suggest that the destruction of language leads inexorably to the destruction of life. The new translations by Tina Howe are clever, crisp and generally similar to previous versions (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Charles Isherwood). *+ ''GUANT\u00c1NAMO: 'HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM.' '' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, for two performances only, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is to portray a British magistrate who objects to the detentions (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60 (Brantley). * ''HEDDA GABLER.'' Ivo van Hove's strange, and strangely enthralling, new production of Ibsen's much-mounted drama about a dangerously frustrated housewife may not necessarily illuminate the play as a dramatic text. His sights are set considerably higher: he is an artist seeking, as Ibsen once did, to illuminate the world around him. The set, designed by his longtime collaborator Jan Versweyveld, is not a reasonable representation of the handsome, expensively appointed home spoken of more than once in the course of the play; the empty, echoing space represents an interior landscape, the cold, underpopulated expanses of Hedda's mind. In a performance that is a major achievement for this adventurous actress, Elizabeth Marvel evokes this process with captivating clarity, tracing the disjointed trajectory of an intellect devouring itself. The rest of the cast is also superb (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65 (Isherwood). * ''MRS. FARNSWORTH.'' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. This turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60 (Brantley). + ''ROSE RAGE.'' This is not, as you might imagine, a comedy about dueling florists. It's a hefty slab of Shakespeare: all three parts of ''Henry VI,'' trimmed of fat and put through a meat grinder, then garnished with generous doses of directorial panache. A freshly sharpened cleaver is the weapon of choice in Edward Hall's flashy, eminently accessible production, which presents 15th-century England as a slaughterhouse doing big business. The three plays are compressed into less than four hours of stage time. (With a generous dinner break and two intermissions, ''Rose Rage'' requires about five and a half hours.) The overriding metaphor, equating war with butchery, is manifested in various arresting ways. A cleaver snaps down on a jiggling pile of organ meat, signifying the fated end of an earl. Globs of flesh drip from plastic bags flung up on meat hooks. Red cabbages, symbolizing traitorous heads, are splintered beneath wooden clubs. But metaphors are by their nature limiting, and Mr. Hall's has worn a bit thin by the end of the long evening. More problematic: Characters emerge only in broad outline here, and a real sense of humanity is largely missing from the production (5:30). The Duke on 42nd Street Theater, 229 West 42nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 6 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $75 (Isherwood). + ''SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW.'' A giggle of clowns led by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90 (Lawrence Van Gelder). Last Chance + ''HERE LIES JENNY.'' Conceived and staged by Roger Rees, with musical direction by Leslie Stifelman and choreography by Ann Reinking, this cigarillo-slender show weaves songs by Kurt Weill into a vague narrative cycle about the life and times of one weary woman. Her name is Jenny, and it seems fitting that she should be portrayed by Bebe Neuwirth, who won Tony Awards playing hard-bitten gals from the shady side of the street in ''Sweet Charity'' and ''Chicago.'' But don't expect lurid thrills. The mood is more pensive than prurient, with Ms. Neuwirth's character presented as a soft, battered, sentimental creature, like a ragdoll that has been played with too hard. ''Here Lies Jenny'' is not the sort of show to kick you into gear for a long night on the town. It's more like a reassuring lullaby, which progresses from brooding nostalgia to hope for the morning to come (1:15). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 5 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $60 (Brantley). ++ ''THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS -- THE MUSICAL!'' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater, and parody is the best kind of narcissism. So many of today's musicals strut fancy sets and special effects. A good parody needs smart writers and winning performers; ''The Musical of Musicals -- The Musical!,'' a York Theater production, has four, and two are the composer Eric Rockwell and the lyricist Joanne Bogart. Taking their plot straight from corny old melodrama, they spoof the styles of Rodgers and Hammerstein, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Kander and Ebb. The Jerry Herman segment is the weakest because his work is the simplest; the pretensions of Lord Lloyd Webber make a better target. The other three are good, zany fun. They have the joie de vivre we want from a musical (1:40). The Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 868-4444. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Margo Jefferson).", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "MANHATTAN (NYC)"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 2183, "offset": 0, "time": 70}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
