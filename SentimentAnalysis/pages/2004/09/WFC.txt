Taking the long view, E. J. Graff, the author of ''What Is Marriage For?'' argues that this institution has never been the immutable, sacred bond that conservative politicians insist it's been for the last 5,000 years. During the first millennium of Christianity, she says, marriage was a secular ceremony involving the exchange of property and the pooling of labor. It wasn't until 1215 that the Roman Catholic Church declared it a sacrament. The romantic concept of a partnership based on love rather than economic utility came later. Today's society, she says, has decided that erotic love is a legitimate reason for marrying, and she adds that same-sex couples qualify under this definition.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "TYING THE KNOT (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DE SEVE, JIM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DOCUMENTARY FILMS AND PROGRAMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MARRIAGES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HOMOSEXUALITY"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 541, "offset": 0, "time": 68}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
