Fortunes have been made here, on the ragged peninsula where St. Michaels and its neighboring towns project out into Chesapeake Bay, since the 1600's -- in farming, trade and fishing, and now in tourism and real estate. St. Michaels escaped damage in the War of 1812 by hanging lanterns in trees outside of town, causing the British to overshoot and earning itself the nickname ''the town that fooled the British.'' Now the invaders are weekenders and vacationers. Most of the leisure crowd in the 19th-century clapboard houses come from Baltimore or Washington; one second-home owner is Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. The traditional economy has been ravaged by parasites attacking the oysters in Chesapeake Bay, but millions are being spent to try to bring the oysters back, and there's never an oyster shortage in the restaurants. STEVE BAILEY Friday 4 p.m. 1. You Want That Malted? If you're looking for a crab-themed anything, you'll find it in the shops on Talbot Street, along with T-shirts, garden sculptures and duck decoys. Stop for ice cream at Justine's (106 South Talbot Street, 410-745-5416), where they'll offer to add malt to any milkshake you can think of. 8 p.m. 2. Dinner From the Bay If you can get a table at 208 Talbot (208 North Talbot Street, 410-745-3838), join the polo-shirt-and-blazer crowd tucking into regional fare like crab cakes ($15) and more extravagant seafood dishes like cassolette of lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp and monkfish ($29.59). On Fridays you may get in without a reservation; Saturdays, when the only option is a popular fixed-price meal ($55) that includes the entire menu, can be impossible. Saturday 8 a.m. 3. Two Wheels to the Ferry Get on a bicycle, which can be rented at the St. Michaels Marina (305 Mulberry Street; 410-745-2400; $11 for a half day) and take advantage of roads so level that almost anyone can be a long-distance rider. Stop at Blue Crab Coffee (102 Fremont Street, 410-745-4155) for light breakfast fare -- not that you really need to fortify yourself for the easy one-hour 7.6-mile ride to the Oxford-Bellevue Ferry (410-745-9023). One segment where the road has no shoulder makes up for the deficiency by having very little traffic. For $5 round trip, the ferry (several trips an hour every day during daylight; closed December through February), a service here since 1683, will take you and your bike on the 10-minute crossing of the Tred Avon River to Oxford, a tiny Colonial-era town. After a spin through its serene tree-lined streets, reboard the ferry for the ride back. Noon 4. Oysters at Harborside This part of Maryland is known as the Bay Hundred -- the name comes from a Colonial division of Maryland into districts that were each required to support 100 militiamen -- and the Bay Hundred is known for seafood: softshell and hardshell crabs in summer and oysters in the fall and winter. For less than $20, you can have a lunch of oysters steamed, fried, Rockefeller or raw at one of the bustling restaurants clustered on St. Michaels Harbor (a good choice is the Town Dock Restaurant, 125 Mulberry Street, 410-745-5577) while you watch the hundreds of boats bobbing at docks or moored in the Miles River. 1 p.m. 5. The Road to Tilghman Now drive out of town the other way on Route 33, toward Tilghman Island, about 14 miles away, and keep an eye on the horizon to your right for masts and sails on the open Chesapeake, just beyond the farm fields. Make a stop in Sherwood, one of several almost invisible communities on the way, at Sherwood Antiques (in the Post Office building, 410-886-2562), an old house stuffed with centuries of furniture and furnishings, like a 19th-century Shaker rocker ($1,800) and an unusual 18th-century bench-table ($1,500) that converts from one to the other. Peer down the tree-lined lanes that lead to Georgian-style manor houses, most still private homes. 2 p.m. 6. Commodore's Log Tilghman Island itself has no manor houses, but it's fast becoming a place for vacationers. Long a working-class community centered around farming and the sea harvest, it lost many of its watermen when the oyster harvest crashed. The old Tilghman can still be seen in the island's venerable skipjacks -- the large sailboats, that are generally the only boats allowed to dredge for oysters in the bay -- based in Dogwood Harbor. Documenting the island's past and present is Gary D. Crawford, above, who with his wife, Susan, owns and operates Crawfords Nautical Books (5782 Main Street, Tilghman, on the right about a mile beyond the bridge, 410-886-2418; www.crawfordsnautical.com). The shop, in a former bank building, has 11,000 or so books, from Mr. Crawford's own works about Tilghman ($5 to $10) to a first edition of Commodore Matthew C. Perry's account of his 1850's trade mission to Japan ($3,400). Tilghman Island Day, an annual seafood festival, is Oct. 16 this year. 3 p.m. 7. The Water Beckons Get out on the water. Rent a kayak ($25 an hour) or a motorboat ($150 to $225 for up to four hours) at the Tilghman Island Marina (6140 Mariners Court, Tilghman; 410-886-2500). Pass through Knapp's Narrows, the strip of water that makes Tilghman an island, to explore expansive Harris Creek on the east or to begin a circumnavigation of the island, which is about three miles long and one mile wide. Pay attention to channel markers and to the chart that comes with the motorboats -- during low tide some areas off Tilghman are too shallow for any propeller-driven craft. Want to let someone else do the driving? The ketch Lady Patty, the converted Vietnam-era special operations vessel Sharps Island (both berthed near the drawbridge; 410-886-2215) and the 1886 skipjack Rebecca T. Ruark (Dogwood Harbor, 410-886-2176) take passengers on excursions. Watch the skies for always-present osprey and the occasional bald eagle. 6 p.m. 8. The Floating Parade Stop in at the Tilghman Island Inn (21384 Coopertown Road, Tilghman; 410-886-2141), a club-like 20-room hotel, where a band may be playing at an outdoor bar. Order a beer and watch as one boat after another returns to the narrows for the night. Stick around for dinner prepared by David McCallum, one of the inn's owners as well as its chef. ''Black eye pea cakes'' ($7.25) are a popular appetizer. Rock fish (striped bass from the Chesapeake, a regional favorite; $29.50) is pan-seared and served over lobster and crab. 9 p.m. 9. Grab a Grappa Perhaps the coziest place to end the day is back in St. Michaels in front of the fireplace at the Purser's Pub at the Inn at Perry Cabin (308 Watkins Lane, 410-745-2200). It was built in 1816, turned into an inn in 1980, purchased by Orient-Express in 1999 and expanded to 81 rooms and suites in 2003. Try one of its 6 grappas ($7 to $15), its 9 ports ($10 to $25) or its 42 Scotches ($9 to $45). Sunday 10 a.m. 10. Heaven for Boat Lovers Learn about skipjacks, push boats and bugeyes at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum (Navy Point, St. Michaels; 410-745-2916; admission $10 for adults). An 18-acre harborfront complex, it includes a relocated Chesapeake lighthouse; buildings devoted to oystering, Chesapeake history, steamboats and waterfowl; and a fleet of distinctive bay boats. One of the smaller buildings, a crab shack, has a plaque on its side showing how high the water reached last year when Hurricane Isabelle hit the area. If you start planning your next visit before you leave, keep in mind the museum's apprentice-for-a-day program, which costs $25 and involves spending a Saturday or Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., helping a shipwright restore a classic bay boat or build a new one. THE BASICS Visiting St. Michaels St. Michaels is about a four-hour drive from New York and about an hour and a half from both Baltimore and Washington, which have the closest major airports. The Inn at Perry Cabin (308 Watkins Lane; 410-745-2200) is a sprawling complex -- some parts almost 200 years old -- on the Miles River adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum. Its 81 rooms and suites are $245 to $625 on weekends. In the heart of St. Michaels, the Old Brick Inn Bed & Breakfast (401 South Talbot Street, 410-745-3323) comprises two buildings, one dating to 1816. Its 14 rooms are $115 to $350. On Tilghman Island and overlooking Dogwood Harbor and its skipjacks, the Chesapeake Wood Duck Inn (21490 Gibsontown Road at Dogwood Harbor, 410-886-2070) has six rooms and one attached cottage at $149 to $229, including a lavish breakfast.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "MARYLAND"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ST MICHAELS (MD)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MARITIME MUSEUM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AGRICULTURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTIQUES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSEUMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Woman, 76, Knifed by Thief, Reaches Police Before Dying"}, "snippet": "A Brooklyn woman fought back as a robber stabbed her a half-dozen times, but died after staggering two blocks to a police station and collapsing on the floor.", "abstract": "Rachel Paliseno, age 76, is stabbed half-dozen times by robber, and dies after staggering two blocks to police station in Bath Beach, Brooklyn; photo (M)", "lead_paragraph": "A 76-year-old Brooklyn woman fought back as a robber stabbed her a half-dozen times yesterday afternoon, but died after staggering two blocks to a police station and collapsing on the floor, the authorities said.
