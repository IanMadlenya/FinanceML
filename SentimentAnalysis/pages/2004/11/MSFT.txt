Beijing's government procurement office changed its mind about buying 29.25 million yuan ($3.5 million) worth of Microsoft Windows and Office software on Nov. 27, 10 days after awarding the contract, according to a statement yesterday on its Web site. The decision underscores the challenge Microsoft, whose Windows software runs almost 95 percent of the world's personal computers, faces in building a profitable business in China. Besides competition from the local industry, which the government wants to promote, Microsoft must also cope with widespread piracy of its products.
