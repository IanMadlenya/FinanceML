The decision to appeal before the United States Supreme Court is good news for the cable industry, upset by a ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that cable modem services should be regulated more like telecommunications services, which are heavily regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. The solicitor general's office filed the appeal Friday night, ahead of a Monday deadline applicable to this case. Although the cable industry had already planned its appeal, industry officials hope the government's involvement will increase the chance of Supreme Court intervention. The Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, ruled last October that F.C.C. regulation of broadband cable services as unregulated ''information services'' was incorrect. The decision came from a lawsuit by a small Internet service provider, filed after the F.C.C. developed rules that lightly regulated cable broadband. Although the cable industry has been nervous about the Ninth Circuit decision, the court ruling does not necessarily force the F.C.C. to change the way it treats cable broadband services. Still, the industry believes that the appeals ruling could make it easier for the F.C.C. to change its mind in the future. Telephone-line-based Internet service providers, like EarthLink Inc., have pressed to have cable broadband services regulated like telecommunications services. One outcome could be regulations requiring cable companies to let other service providers sell Internet access over their cable lines. The underlying lawsuit was filed in 2002 by Brand X Internet Services, a small company based in Santa Monica, Calif.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "BRAND X INTERNET SERVICES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SOLICITORS GENERAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REGULATION AND DEREGULATION OF INDUSTRY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Hollinger Files Stinging Report On Ex-Officials"}, "snippet": "Conrad Black and other controlling shareholders of Hollinger used $400 million for personal perks, a new report says.", "abstract": "Special committee of Hollinger International issues lengthy report, shot through with sarcasm and disgust, which concludes that former officers Conrad M Black and F David Radler ran 'corporate kleptocracy,' diverting to themselves virtually all of company's $400 million in earnings over seven years; Black photo; report, part of publishing company's attempt to recover $1.25 billion from Black and others, faults 'ineffective and careless' directors for not stopping 'systematic looting' and demands director Richard N Perle return $5.4 million in pay for putting his own interests above shareholders; charges Black and Radler combined 'bombast' about own accomplishments with lining their pockets almost every day; charges include use of corporate jet, $90,000 Rolls-Royce refurbishing, $42,870 birthday party for wife and dinners for board member Henry Kissinger; Ravelston Corp, Black and Radler holding company that effectively controls Hollinger, dismisses report; two resigned last fall over unauthorized payments; other report charges detailed (M)", "lead_paragraph": "In a 513-page report shot through with sarcasm and disgust, a special committee of the publishing company Hollinger International Inc. concluded that the former officials Conrad M.
