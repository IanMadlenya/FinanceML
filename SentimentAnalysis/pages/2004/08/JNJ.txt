Ms. Witherspoon, as usual, conveys a bristly, determined spunk. But if her performance emits enough sparks to hold the screen, it never ignites a dramatic brush fire. Despite her make-do British accent, she is quintessentially American in attitude and body language, even more a fish out of water in ''Vanity Fair'' than she seemed in ''The Importance of Being Earnest.'' Ms. Witherspoon's upbeat approach in the film, which opens today, makes her Becky more likable than other portrayals (and there have been many, most famously by Miriam Hopkins in the 1935 movie ''Becky Sharp,'' the first Hollywood feature in Technicolor). But with its diminished gravitas, this Becky comes across as a lightweight schemer about as formidable as an aspiring trophy wife on a daytime soap. When the movie is over, you half expect Ms. Witherspoon to turn to the camera and plead, ''You still like me, don't you?''", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "VANITY FAIR (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WITHERSPOON, REESE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "NAIR, MIRA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "ATKINS, EILEEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "THACKERAY, WILLIAM MAKEPEACE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "MEYERS, JONATHAN RHYS"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BYRNE, GABRIEL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HOSKINS, BOB"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "BROADBENT, JIM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "J.P.
