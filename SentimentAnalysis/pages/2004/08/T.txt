The report contends that the company's former chief executive, Conrad M. Black; its former chief operating officer, F. David Radler; and their private holding company, Ravelston, took steps to enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders. The report is also sharply critical of a number of Hollinger's directors, focusing particular attention on Richard N. Perle, the former head of the Defense Policy Board: Hollinger is a publishing company, but the story of the last decade at Hollinger, which is the subject of this report, is not about Hollinger's valuable publishing assets or the quality of the staff at its many publications. Rather, this story is about how Hollinger was systematically manipulated and used by its controlling shareholders for their sole benefit, and in a manner that violated every concept of fiduciary duty. Not once or twice, but on dozens of occasions Hollinger was victimized by its controlling shareholders as they transferred to themselves and their affiliates more than $400 million in the last seven years. ... Hollinger under Black and Radler lost any sense of corporate purpose, competitive drive or internal ethical concerns. The internal focus became exclusively how to generate opportunities to suck cash out of Hollinger and into Ravelston, if not into the hands of Black and Radler directly. The pace and scale of the effort to siphon away Hollinger's cash is noticeable in the minutes of the audit committee's meeting of Feb. 22, 2000. In a meeting lasting 65 minutes, Black and Radler won approval for (i) $38 million in management fees to themselves through Ravelston, (ii) the Hollinger Digital incentive plan (through which the ''senior executive group'' received $5.3 million) and (iii) the sale for $1 of Hollinger's Skagit Valley Argus and The Journal of the San Juan Islands to Horizon (then secretly 73 percent owned by Black and Radler) with a ''working capital adjustment'' that turned into a $162,000 payment from Hollinger to Horizon to take its properties. In roughly one hour, Hollinger's audit committee considered more related-party payments than many companies consider in their entire existence.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "HOLLINGER INTERNATIONAL INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACCOUNTING AND ACCOUNTANTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOARDS OF DIRECTORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ETHICS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "To Businesses Near the Garden, A Boom Looks a Lot Like a Bust"}, "snippet": "Businesses in the streets around Madison Square Garden, one of the city's most vibrant commercial districts, are struggling during the Republican convention.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "It is a central tenet of Republican political ideology that government interference is an important obstacle to economic growth.
