The academy, the film industry and the gods of chance and history all seemed to be sparing no effort to ensure that this year's Oscars would be as normal, as uneventful and as predictable as possible -- to honor tradition by producing a generic extravaganza. Last fall in a fit of high-mindedness the academy decided to restrain the crass and unseemly campaigning that had marred previous years -- that is, that had made the run-up to the ceremony ever more colorful and entertaining for journalists and other would-be insiders. The handsomely printed document announcing stern new rules and restrictions had, without evident irony, lamented the incursion of hucksterism into the proceedings. Hucksterism in the movie business?
