The appointment of Mr. Nagano, the artistic director and principal conductor of the Deutsches Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin, principal conductor of the Los Angeles Opera, music director of the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra in California since 1978 and designated successor in 2006 to Zubin Mehta as music director of the Bavarian State Opera, would begin with the 2006-7 season. The Montreal Symphony would not comment on the report but said it would announce a successor to Mr. Dutoit this month. The post of music director of the Montreal Symphony has been vacant since spring 2002, when Mr. Dutoit, who had held the position for 25 years, resigned abruptly after the Quebec Musicians Guild issued an open letter likening the musicians under him to battered spouses who ''have quietly endured years of verbal and psychological abuse and now want it to stop.''", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "The Making of a Candidate; This Soldier's Story"}, "snippet": "Nineteen-sixty-eight was a year unlike any other I have known.

In 2002, Brazil submitted Fernando Meirelles's urban thriller for the foreign-language Oscar. Academy voters didn't seem too impressed, though, and five other nominees were selected instead. The next year, with a nudge from Miramax, ''City of God'' opened on more than 150 screens across the United States, garnered rapturous reviews and ended up on a number of critics' 10-best lists. When the film was up for Oscar consideration a second time, this time in the general competition, it scooped up four prominent nominations, including best director and best adapted screenplay. So what was not, a year ago, one the best foreign films is now one of the best films, period. One voting member said of ''City of God'': ''That itself is a real insult to our committee. We didn't even nominate 'City of God' for foreign film and now it's got four nominations.'' As tonight's ceremony approaches, the foreign-language category remains Oscar's annual head-scratcher. Ask anyone in the industry about this year's nominees -- which include one critical hit, ''The Barbarian Invasions'' from Canada, and four films that barely register -- and you'll find varying levels of bafflement. ''For the most part, of the films that are selected, I don't think anyone understands why,'' says Ryan Werner, head of distribution at Wellspring, which releases a number of foreign titles each year. Mark Urman, of ThinkFilm, says, ''I can't tell you how many people were shocked by the nominations this year.'' Both were hoping their company's films would be included, but their sentiments are shared by executives and voters alike. Ken Rudolph, a former documentary filmmaker and a voter in the foreign-language film category since 1980, admits: ''I'm not saying I believe these are the best foreign films that exist. I don't think anybody's saying that. It's a very strange category.''", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "ACADEMY OF MOTION PICTURE ARTS AND SCIENCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ACADEMY AWARDS (OSCARS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "GOING OUT", "kicker": "ON THE TOWNS"}, "snippet": "A guide to cultural and recreational goings-on around the state this week.
