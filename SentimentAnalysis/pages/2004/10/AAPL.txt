''Customer'' isn't even the right word -- ''follower'' is more like it -- and what these people feel is devotion.

Aside from partisans for the Macintosh, there are also many determined fans of a smaller, hand-held device who are so united in their devotion that they form a kind of secret society. No, not iPod fans. Newton fans. The devotion of Newton users is all the more extraordinary because the product, introduced in the early 1990's, was a notorious flop. The Newton, you may recall, was a forerunner of today's popular Personal Digital Assistants, like the PalmPilot, that rely on a penlike stylus. (According to the lore, a series of ''Doonesbury'' installments mocking early handwriting-recognition problems was a pivotal event in the Newton's sad trajectory; in any case, this was an instance when the ''early adopters'' so beloved by tech-business gurus were laughed out of the room.) The Newton was killed off by Apple in 1998; yet consumer loyalty has outlived production itself.
