It has been five years since his pretty-good solo debut, and he has released only a handful of (not very good) tracks. And yet he is regularly lionized as one of hip-hop most important voices, as a socially conscious visionary, as a fearless musical explorer. None of these claims are borne out by his spotty discography, but no matter: who needs new releases when you've got a reputation like that? It's not really fair to blame Mos Def for his reputation -- and besides, he has spent the last few years establishing himself as an actor (most notably in the play ''Topdog/Underdog''). But we can certainly blame him for ''The New Danger'' (Geffen), the long-awaited follow-up to his 1999 debut, ''Black on Both Sides.''
