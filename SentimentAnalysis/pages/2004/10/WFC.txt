It has been five years since his pretty-good solo debut, and he has released only a handful of (not very good) tracks. And yet he is regularly lionized as one of hip-hop most important voices, as a socially conscious visionary, as a fearless musical explorer. None of these claims are borne out by his spotty discography, but no matter: who needs new releases when you've got a reputation like that? It's not really fair to blame Mos Def for his reputation -- and besides, he has spent the last few years establishing himself as an actor (most notably in the play ''Topdog/Underdog''). But we can certainly blame him for ''The New Danger'' (Geffen), the long-awaited follow-up to his 1999 debut, ''Black on Both Sides.''

He has the mincing drawl and sad-flirtatious tone down pat, which is no surprise, for he's a longtime Williams imitator named Jeremy Lawrence, who between gigs on sitcoms performs his ''Talking Tennessee'' one-man show around the country. What is a surprise is seeing him wander through a Manhattan Theater Club production called ''Five by Tenn,'' now in previews at City Center; ''Five by Tenn'' is billed as an evening of ''newly discovered one-act plays'' by Tennessee Williams -- not featuring him. Yet there he is as the lights go up, typing assiduously and reading stage directions and saying: ''I don't think you can escape being personal in your writing. That doesn't mean that you are one of the characters in the play.'' The real Williams did not write this role; it was stitched together, like a Frankenstein monster, from odd bits of leftover prose: interviews, letters, journals and memoirs. But the resulting character of Tennessee Williams, narrator, says a lot about the current state of the work of Tennessee Williams, playwright. For the ''Five by Tenn'' composite is just one of the many liberties being taken with Williams's legacy now that he and his original heir are dead, and a university with a financial interest (and little theatrical experience) is in charge of his estate. The volume of productions is way up, quality is arguably down, and controversy has been stirred by the licensing of previously unproduced works like ''Five by Tenn.'' Only the last of its one-acts, a Beckettian duet called ''I Can't Imagine Tomorrow,'' was published and performed in Williams's lifetime.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WILLIAMS, TENNESSEE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SANNEH, KELEFA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MANHATTAN THEATER CLUB"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "McGreevey And His Aides Barely Wait For the Sunset"}, "snippet": "While Gov.
