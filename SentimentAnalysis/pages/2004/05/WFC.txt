It didn't reassure him to see the Egypt Air mechanic pumping oil into the plane with a foot pump as we walked to the plane. Earlier that day, the weather reports had indicated that the Cairo airport was closed because of heavy sandstorms, but the ticket agent at the counter in Dubai assured us the weather in Cairo was fine. About halfway through the flight, the pilot came on the intercom and said that because of fierce sandstorms, the Cairo airport was advising all flights to land elsewhere. He said we were going to land at a remote airstrip at the south end of the Red Sea and take a 14-hour bus ride the rest of the way.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "EBAY INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths   ROSS, ARTHUR M., JR."}, "snippet": "ROSS--Arthur M., Jr. On May 20, 2004 at the age of 91, Arthur M.
