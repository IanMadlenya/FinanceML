Granito, Jr., of Stamford, CT died suddenly on February 27, 2013 at the age of 81. Affectionately known as Ditto, he was born August 8, 1931 in New York City to Dr. Frank and Nora Granito. Frank grew up happily in the Bronx and attended Cardinal Hayes High School (where he was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2004), the University of Chicago, Fairfield University and St. John's Law School. During the 1950's and 60's, Frank served as a Naval Aviator with the Pacific Fleet and with the Naval Reserve, flying a variety of fighter and attack aircraft. A renowned aviation law specialist, Frank spent the past 46 years with his firm, Speiser, Krause, Nolan & Granito and for the past 25 years practiced law with his son Frank. He was a mentor to many. As an active trial lawyer representing families of aviation disasters, Frank was involved in nearly every major aviation case of the past 50 years. Notably, among the cases Frank participated in were the following air disaster litigations: Mohawk Airlines, Rochester (1963); United Airlines, Parrotsville (1964); Canadian Pacific Airways, Tokyo (1966); Overseas National Airways, St. Croix (1970); TWA 707, Ionian Sea (1974); Eastern Airlines Flight 66, JFK (1975 ); Texasgulf Aviation (1981); Spantax DC-10, Spain (1982); LOT Polish Airlines, Warsaw (1987); Pan Am Flight 103 (1988); Avianca Flight 052 (1990); Action Air B-99, Bridgeport (1994); USAir DC-9, Charlotte (1994); USAF CT-43, Croatia (1996); TWA Flight 800 (1996); Swissair Flight 111 (1998); Egyptair Flight 990 (1999); AA Flight 587 (2001) and the litigation arising from the 9/11 tragedy. Frank was instrumental in continuing the fight of the Pan Am 103 families in holding Libya accountable for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The historic settlement resulted in compensation for the Pan Am 103 families and the framework for renewed diplomatic relations between Libya and the United States. Frank and his colleagues who negotiated the settlement with Libya were awarded the 2009 Public Justice Trial Lawyer of the Year Award. Frank was an adjunct professor of aviation law at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and a frequent lecturer at Fordham and St. John's Law Schools. He lectured and wrote extensively about aviation, choice of law and trial practice. His expertise was renown. When he wasn't at work, he was most times painting or attending to his memoirs, with a keen ability to recall events of many decades ago with mystifying detail. Extremely proud of his Bronx roots, Frank maintained lifelong friendships with his pals from Clason Point, Cardinal Hayes and St. John's. Equally proud of his service to our country, he held annual reunions with his squadron mates. And his cadre of warhorse aviation lawyers, the Sunshine Boys, held monthly \"lunch meetings\" to reminisce of days gone by. Frank was a devout Catholic and a person who quietly but generously supported those many causes near and dear to his heart. He was happiest when surrounded by his family, especially his wonderful grandchildren of whom he was so proud, and his beautiful bride whom he cherished so dearly. Frank is survived by his wife of 56 years, Helen Elizabeth \"Betty\" Altieri. He was the proud father of Catherine and Tim Langan, Frank III and Monica, Nora and Dan Harris and John and Luci. Frank was blessed with 16 grandchildren: Timmy, Matty, Mark and John Langan, Frank IV, Jimmy Joe, Jake, Catherine and Gunnar Granito, Cathleen, Will, Peter and Charlie Harris, John and Julia Granito. Frank was predeceased by his grandson Luke Langan. Brother of Nora (Cass) Chomicz, Gennaro (Maureen), Eileen (Andy) Simons, Sheila (Don) Dunphy. Predeceased by his sister Margaret Rose and brother John Teeple. Brother-in-law of Richard (Sharon) Altieri, Jimmy (Geri) Altieri and Johnny (Kathleen) Altieri, and loving uncle to many nieces and nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews. Visiting hours will be held Sunday, March 3, 2013 from noon to 6pm at the Leo P. Gallagher & Son Funeral Home, 2900 Summer St., Stamford, CT 06905. A funeral Mass will be held on Monday, March 4, 2013 at 11am at St. Leo Roman Catholic Church located at 24 Roxbury Rd., Stamford, CT 06902. A private interment will be held on Tuesday morning.
