Warm-hearted, civic-minded, witty and exuberant, he lived a full and fascinating life. As a young Army officer commanding American and British troops in North Africa, he received both the Bronze Star and membership in the Order of the British Empire, and eventually rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Nina was the dearly beloved wife of the late Bill Finkelstein. She was the beloved mother of Jane Finkelstein of Rhode island and Emily Kravinsky of Philadelphia, the dearly loved grandmother of Josh, Sarah, Lev and Eli, the beloved sister of Michael Sachs and the late David Sachs. Nina was deeply loved by numerous friends, cousins, nieces and nephews to whom she was endlessly loyal and supportive. Nina was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1927 as Nina Rose Sachs, daughter of Alfred Henry (Alter Chaim) and Estelle Dolcort Sachs. Nina moved with her family to New York at age 20 after attending college at Case Western Reserve. She completed her bachelor's degree in New York. In college, she was the National Secretary of the Intercollegiate Zionist Federation of America. In 1953, Nina married the great love and best friend of her life, Bill Finkelstein. Bill died tragically in 1991 of ALS. No relationship could have combined enduring love and friendship more powerfully than Nina and Bill's marriage. Nina worked in several publishing houses as an editor including Dell, Fawcett and Bantam. She was the executive director of World Monuments Fund. She became one of the founding editors of Ms. Magazine in 1971 and was deeply invested in the feminist movement. Following her retirement in 1988, Nina became involved in a myriad of volunteer activities including reading to the blind, teaching English as a second language, GED mentorship for disadvantaged young women and tutoring special needs children in inner city schools. In all of her volunteer jobs, Nina formed deep and personal connections with the people she worked with that always had a quality of deep respect and reciprocity. Nina was deeply committed to a sense of justice and was always there to advocate for people. As an example, she arranged a rent strike in our building in the early 70's and was the first parent to stand up to her children's school in a successful effort to sanction an abusive teacher and to have her removed. She took action. She was fiercely protective. Always attuned to the needs of others, she brought home books for years for her husband and children that perfectly matched their interests of the time. Wonderful books seemed to emerge magically and ceaselessly from her black work bag. Nina was deeply committed to her family and friends. She had a passion for travel. She and her beloved husband Bill spent 25 consecutive summers in Venice at the Pensione Seguso and later traveled to India and many other European and Asian countries. Nina had boundless intellectual curiosity and adored reading. She was always immersed in a book and frequently consulted with her friend Chris Lenahan, the manager of the Corner Bookstore, about contemporary literature. Nina was passionate about New York and also deeply loved the small seaside town of PointLookout where she and our family spent many blissfully happy summers. In latter years, she became increasingly disabled by arthritis and poor mobility following a stroke. In spite of her pain and ongoing, profound grief for her late husband, Bill, she persevered with remarkably heroic courage, taking classes at Hunter College and traveling until she was no longer able to continue due to poor mobility. She read endlessly and saw numerous movies, plays, opera and ballet. She was an avid and highly skilled bridge player, winning a number of tournaments which she was always quite modest about. During her last hospitalization following a fall, her friends organized a bridge game in a hall at Mt. Sinai. In her last weeks, she had a characteristically warm and enlivening dinner party at her home with several beloved friends. Nina deeply loved and always felt a great interest in her four grandchildren. When she was unable to continue to travel to Philadelphia to visit them, she maintained contact by telephone. When the children were young, she arranged memorable vacations for them and also always strove to find them toys and books that she knew they loved just as she had done for her children. Nina was overcome with happiness to be able to participate in the Bar Mitzvah of her youngest grandchild, Eli, this past December. Nina will always be remembered by those who knew her best for a spirit of commitment to the people she loved and to the causes she felt deeply about. She had more earnestness and courage than anyone I have ever known. She was always there to provide support and was very quiet about her own struggles and pain. We will love her and yearn for her forever and feel endlessly grateful for her unfailing, quiet generosity, loyalty and presence.

He was an engaging, witty, and well-dressed socialite with an uncanny ability to recall names and facts, recount entertaining anecdotes, and offer insightful analyses on a wide range of subjects.

Bob was a passionate skier and, on winter weekends, could almost always be found catching the first chairlift at Deer Valley (where he maintained a perfect season-pass record) and, apres ski, holding court at Stein Eriksen Lodge.
