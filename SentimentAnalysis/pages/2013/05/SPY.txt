David was a graduate of Cheshire Academy and Bradley University and remained actively involved on the Boards of both institutions. He was proud to have served his country as a Lieutenant in the United States Air Force. David was an astute businessman, a caring philanthropist, and generously gave both his time and valuable advice to those organizations in which he was involved. He was Chairman of the Board of Checker Motors Corporation, past President of Great Dane Trailers, and served on numerous corporate boards over his business career. David was past President of the U.S. Tennis Association 1989-1990. David employed his remarkable talent and keen vision in chairing the U.S. Open site committee in the mid 1990's, which planned and executed the revitalization of the National Tennis Center, including the construction of Arthur Ashe Stadium, the centerpiece of the U.S. Open and one of the finest sports facilities in the world. David was currently serving as a member of the USTA Major Construction Oversight Committee. An avid player and supporter of the sport, David was devoted to giving back to the game he loved so much. Prior to becoming USTA President, David was President of USTA Midwest, and is enshrined in both the USTA Midwest and USTA Eastern Halls of Fame. He also served as Chairman of the Davis Cup Committee, the Junior Tennis Council, and was, for many years, the official referee of the National 16-18 Boys Championships in Kalamazoo, MI. He was awarded the Samuel Hardy Award for long and outstanding service to the sport in 1991, and in 2010, was presented a USTA Volunteer Service Award for 40 years of devotion to tennis. There is a plaque on the outside wall of Arthur Ashe Stadium bearing David's likeness with an inscription that reads, \"His inspiration and hard work made Arthur Ashe Stadium a reality.\" David was an avid art collector and served as a Trustee of the Museum for African Art soon to be opened in New York City. At the time of David's death, he served as Chairman of the Board of the MorseLife Foundation in West Palm Beach, FL. David was a true and loyal friend, and will be sorely missed not only by his devoted family but also by all who had the privilege and pleasure of knowing him.
