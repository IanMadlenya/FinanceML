There are nine grandchildren - Mary, Jack, Emily and Benjamin Bierwirth, Patrick and Kimberly Woolam and Alex, Cooper and Ethan Arbios - and two great-grandchildren--Gloria and Grant Woolam. Further, as part of a close and loving family are children-in-law Jane Bierwirth, Chris Woolam and Bill Arbios and granddaughter-in-law Valerie Woolam. In the World War II years Jack served in the US Navy ending that career as a Lt. (j.g.). After the war he completed his education at Yale ('45W) and Columbia Law (JD '50). His business career started at White and Case (law) and continued at NY Trust (banking), National Distillers and Chemical Corp (petrochemicals) and Grumman (aerospace). He was particularly pleased the success of the petrochemical operations he initiated in Japan, Taiwan, Belgium, Brazil, Finland and Yugoslavia. There were also other successful operations in Northern Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Argentina and Bolivia. At Grumman his first task was to rework contracts with the US Navy to avert Grumman's threatened bankruptcy. This was accomplished in 1973. While at Grumman as chairman, the relationships with the US Navy, the US Air Force and NASA were substantially enlarged, and the company successfully diversified into electronics and computer software. His final major effort was leading a joint venture with General Motors in a contract with the US Postal Service to produce thousands of postal delivery trucks which are still on the road today. Athletics were always a part of his life. He was a squash racquets player and baseball pitcher at Yale though he suffered a real disappointment in the spring of 1943 when he came down with a case of the measles on the day he was to pitch for Yale against the Boston Braves. After Yale his special interests were tennis and fly fishing for trout, especially when with family members. There was a public service side to his career. He was able to be a small part of the US/Chinese effort to persuade the Russians to leave Afghanistan. Later he joined Cyrus Vance and Brent Scowcroft on a committee to work with the People's Republic of China to further the peace process in East Asia. As Vance and Scowcroft took other assignments Jack became chairman of the US side, a role continued for several years. He also served on the boards of many environmental organizations, the Yale China Association and Adelphi University.
