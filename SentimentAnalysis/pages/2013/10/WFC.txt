Previously, Mary Anne was the first woman Chair of the NYC Hospital Visiting Committee for the United Hospital Fund of NY, and the first woman President of the Plymouth Church Council. In the 1980's, she served as Director of Marketing for the City's largest home ownership program, at the Partnership for New York City. She is survived by her loving husband of 57 years, Richard, a former Managing Director of the investment banking firm Dillon, Read & Co. Inc., her brother Monte G. Shaffer, of Prosser, WA, her three children, Leslie of Whitefish, MT, Jennifer Young (Brian) of Taos, NM, and Richard Jr. (Inger) of Brooklyn, NY, as well as her five beloved grandsons, Gavin, Connor, Oliver, Felix and Neal.
