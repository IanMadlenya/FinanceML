Son of Giuseppe and Alessandra (nee Zizzamia), he was raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, attended Stuyvesant High School and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1951 with a BA in English. After honorable discharge from the U.S. Army 112th Infantry Regiment for service during the Korean War, he earned his Masters in English from Columbia University. He then began teaching technical writing at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, Columbia University and NYU. By 1970, he had moved his family to Westfield, NJ. There, he founded and ran Metascience, Inc., teaching writing and communications skills critical to the scientists and engineers of Bell Labs, Exxon, Aramco, General Foods, Union Carbide, Ciba-Geigy Alcoa, Rohm & Haas and others. In the world of martial arts, Charles was instrumental in the formation of what's now known as the U. S. Soo Bahk Do Moo Duk Kwan Federation and served as its first Chairman. He retired to Brielle in 2003, in a house he and his wife, Olga (nee Balas), designed, to be near his grandchildren. There, he was able to pursue his passions for reading, gardening and cooking. He also gave wise and heartfelt counsel, and provided generously to many in his family. He will be dearly missed by his wife; his sons and their wives, Charles Gian and Sara, Milan Christopher and Michelle, and Nicolas; his grandchildren, Alexa Marie and Christopher Milan; and all those who knew him. He and Olga would have celebrated their 51st wedding anniversary on October 6th. A memorial gathering was held privately Sunday, September 29th.
