I appreciate my friend's commitment to peace and security. I appreciate his vision. I appreciate his willingness to lead. Most importantly, I appreciate his understanding that after Sept. 11, 2001, the world changed; that we face a common enemy -- terrorists willing to kill innocent lives; that we now recognize that threats which gather in remote regions of the world must be dealt with before others lose their lives. Tony Blair is a friend; he's a friend of the American people, he's a friend of mine. I trust his judgment, and I appreciate his wisdom.
