Most importantly, I appreciate his understanding that after Sept. 11, 2001, the world changed; that we face a common enemy -- terrorists willing to kill innocent lives; that we now recognize that threats which gather in remote regions of the world must be dealt with before others lose their lives. Tony Blair is a friend; he's a friend of the American people, he's a friend of mine. I trust his judgment, and I appreciate his wisdom.

The Federal Communications Commission says this change will eliminate the hurdle faced by phone companies that can't offer new customers the beloved 212 area code -- thus fostering local telephone service competition. Regardless, Manhattanites are sure to complain. But for longtime residents of the outer boroughs like me, this is sweet justice. All five city boroughs shared the 212 area code until 1985 when Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island changed to 718. The Bronx lost its 212 privilege in 1993. I grew up in Belle Harbor, Queens, which has views of the Manhattan skyline but couldn't be farther from ''the city.'' Like many ''bridge and tunnelers'' (the nickname for those of us who have to cross a river to get to the city), all I ever wanted was to move into Manhattan.
