I appreciate my friend's commitment to peace and security. I appreciate his vision. I appreciate his willingness to lead. Most importantly, I appreciate his understanding that after Sept. 11, 2001, the world changed; that we face a common enemy -- terrorists willing to kill innocent lives; that we now recognize that threats which gather in remote regions of the world must be dealt with before others lose their lives. Tony Blair is a friend; he's a friend of the American people, he's a friend of mine. I trust his judgment, and I appreciate his wisdom.

After nearly 13 years the restaurant has shed its Garbo-like image of secrecy, transforming the ground floor into a modern-looking cafe with diner overtones. The upstairs bar has been moved downstairs, the entrance to the restaurant has been shifted northward to the corner of Prince and Crosby Streets, and huge windows now make the Savoy's interior almost shockingly visible to the outside world. The upstairs remains old-fashioned and intimate. The brick fireplace survives intact. Peter Hoffman, the Savoy's chef and owner, sticks with the same cooking philosophy that has won the Savoy a loyal following over the years, shopping the greenmarkets for local produce and pushing organic foods whenever possible. The makeover now gives him two formats: an all-day cafe menu and a more formal menu in the upstairs dining room. Downstairs the diners can construct a casual lunch, starting with small plates like charred eggplant with lemon and olive oil served with grilled bread or black-eyed pea fritters with cilantro relish. Pastas and sandwiches outnumber main courses. Conch pasta, tossed with spicy homemade Italian sausage, gets a fresh, crunchy lift from tiny Brussels sprout leaves, barely cooked.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "SOHO (NYC)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SAVOY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESTAURANTS"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 411, "offset": 0, "time": 66}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
