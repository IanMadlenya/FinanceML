Director Emeritus of Buxton School died at home in Williamstown, MA, February 18th in the company of his family. Born in NYC, October 24, 1914, son of William M. and Helen Hamlin Fincke, he attended Avon Old Farms School in Avon, CT, and graduated in 1937 from Harvard. Before working at Buxton, he had been co-director of his family's boarding school, the former Manumit School in Pennsylvania in the 1940's. He taught at Buxton until he became ill a year ago. During the period of his illness, and long hospitalization, and after his return, Ben was marvelously alert, positive, irreverent and witty. In short, he was Ben-right up to the end. He leaves his wife, the former Magdalene Joslyn; a son, Dr. Graeme Fincke of Cambridge, MA; two daughters, Magdalene Sears of NYC, and Catherine Fincke of Brooklyn, NY; a step-daughter Mary Lathrop of NYC, and four grandchildren. He also leaves several nieces and nephews. Contributions in memory of Mr. Fincke may be made to the Buxton School for the Benjamin G. C. Fincke Scholarship Fund, 291 South St, Williamstown, MA 01267. A memorial service will be held at 2 PM, on Sunday, June 15th at the First Congregational Church in Williamstown. A reception at Buxton School will follow.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  Blair, Thomas S."}, "snippet": "BLAIR-Thomas S., Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Directors of Blair Strip Steel Company, New Castle, PA, died of heart failure on Saturday, May 10, 2003, in Boynton Beach, FL.

Mr. Blair was born April 15, 1922 in New Castle, PA, the son of George Dike Blair Jr. and Hazel Slingluff Blair. He graduated from The Hill School in Pottstown, PA and from Williams College in Williamstown, MA. During World War II, he was a research associate on the Manhattan Project, working in laboratories at Columbia University in New York City and at Oak Ridge, TN, primarily on processes for the separation of uranium isotopes necessary for the development of the atom bomb. Following the War, Mr. Blair was Associate Editor, handling technical articles, for ``The Iron Age,'' a weekly steel industry publication headquartered in New York City. In 1949 he returned to New Castle, becoming President of Blair Strip Steel Company, a position he held until 1984. After that date he continued as Chairman of the Board of the Company, and then in recent years as Chairman Emeritus. In other business activities, Mr. Blair served as a Director of The Columbia Gas System, Inc; Columbia Gas of PA; Columbia Gas of MD; Tuscarora, Inc; Matflo Corp; Southeastern Plastics Corp; The Union Trust Company; and The First National Bank of Lawrence County Pennsylvania.

Before they rolled into place, in the innocent days when security just meant men with submachine guns, a travel book could be fluffy, silly, familiar or carefully manufactured, and it hardly mattered. Afterward, every destination acquired a sudden glow of hellfire, every trip an element of thoroughly unwanted suspense. Escape has become a problem in itself. A travel book without danger -- to the body, the soul or the future -- is entirely out of time. Such books, I can report, are still appearing. There are droll encounters with simple, cunning nut-brown persons, continent by continent, books where you can hear the jokes being harvested, cut and squeezed like dry lemons. Gentle novelists still jet to tourist spots, hoping a metaphor and a bit of reflection will make up for not quite seeing or understanding anything. Writers in their 20's try to get away with lyrical books about places they seem to think their parents never reached. No known force can stop the British freelancer from going abroad to live and assuming that it matters. American academics go abroad, it seems, mostly to buy chintz or terra cotta, but their books are just as long. And then there is the seasonal quota of journeys made only because someone offered a contract -- made by pilgrims after knowledge, with a camera crew in the following car.
