Director Emeritus of Buxton School died at home in Williamstown, MA, February 18th in the company of his family. Born in NYC, October 24, 1914, son of William M. and Helen Hamlin Fincke, he attended Avon Old Farms School in Avon, CT, and graduated in 1937 from Harvard. Before working at Buxton, he had been co-director of his family's boarding school, the former Manumit School in Pennsylvania in the 1940's. He taught at Buxton until he became ill a year ago. During the period of his illness, and long hospitalization, and after his return, Ben was marvelously alert, positive, irreverent and witty. In short, he was Ben-right up to the end. He leaves his wife, the former Magdalene Joslyn; a son, Dr. Graeme Fincke of Cambridge, MA; two daughters, Magdalene Sears of NYC, and Catherine Fincke of Brooklyn, NY; a step-daughter Mary Lathrop of NYC, and four grandchildren. He also leaves several nieces and nephews. Contributions in memory of Mr. Fincke may be made to the Buxton School for the Benjamin G. C. Fincke Scholarship Fund, 291 South St, Williamstown, MA 01267. A memorial service will be held at 2 PM, on Sunday, June 15th at the First Congregational Church in Williamstown. A reception at Buxton School will follow.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Sosa Delivers, Ending 16 Scoreless Innings", "kicker": "NATIONAL LEAGUE: ROUNDUP"}, "snippet": "After striking out five times over 15 scoreless innings, Sammy Sosa hit a run-scoring single in the bottom of the 16th to give the Chicago Cubs a 1-0 victory over the Houston Astros yesterday.

All this is the entirely predictable result of New York State's policy of ''retreat from eroding shorelines.'' This wasn't the policy of coastal engineers at the state Department of Environmental Conservation, but of nonengineers at the state Department of State. We can talk about the logic of having one state agency determine policy while another has to deal with the effects of that policy some other time. But New York's retreat policy dovetails nicely with those of the United States Department of the Interior that call for noninterference with ''natural processes.''

But recordings can provide another kind of intimacy. Six months after that concert Mr. Andsnes recorded the sonata for EMI Classics in London. The CD has just been released, the second in a series of Schubert programs that offer Mr. Andsnes playing a major solo work and accompanying his close colleague, the English tenor Ian Bostridge, in selected songs.
