Believed to Have Been Written on Jan. 22 In my humble technical opinion, this is the wrong (and bordering on irresponsible) answer from the SSP [space shuttle program] and Orbiter not to request additional imaging help from any outside source. I must emphasize (again) that severe enough damage (3 or 4 multiple tiles knocked out down to the densification layer) combined with the heating and resulting damage to the underlying structure at the most critical location (viz., MLG [main landing gear] Door/wheels/tires/hydraulics or the X1191 spar cap) could present potentially grave hazards. The engineering team will admit it might not achieve definitive high confidence answers present potentially grave hazards. The engineering team will admit it might not achieve definitive high confidence answers even with additional images, but, without action to request help clarify the damage visually, we will guarantee it will not.
