The audit is the latest round in a larger debate on how government can foster the growth of Internet commerce without choking off vital state tax revenues. ''Our decision sends a message to national retailers: Do not try to use the Internet as a tax haven for your California stores that constitute one-eighth of our great nation's retail market,'' said Carole Migden, chairwoman of the Board of Equalization, the state tax agency. Barnes & Noble, the bookstore chain, has 84 stores in California, but maintains that Barnesandnoble.com, an entity in which it owns a 38 percent stake, does not have a physical presence in the state. ''We collect sales tax in those states where we have a physical presence,'' said a company spokeswoman, Carolyn Brown. She said those states were New York, New Jersey, Tennessee and Nevada. Barnesandnoble.com is the second-largest Internet book retailer behind Amazon.com, which has no physical presence in California. A huge shortfall in the state's budget has added urgency to the debate over how to increase state revenue in California.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "CALIFORNIA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BARNES & NOBLE"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BARNESANDNOBLE.COM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STATES (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAXATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SALES TAX"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "A First-Quarter Profit Reported by Clear Channel"}, "snippet": "Clear Channel Communications Inc., the biggest owner of radio stations in the United States, said today that it reversed a loss in the first quarter as expenses fell and sales rose.
