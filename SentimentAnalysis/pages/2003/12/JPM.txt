Allow it to flow downhill past the blades of a turbine, turning them as it rushes by. Attach the turbine to a generator, and power is generated -- hydroelectric power, the kind produced by the megawatt at dams around the world. But there is another, far less familiar way of generating electricity from the movement of water. Dripping it through microscopic channels -- the kind found by the hundreds of thousands in a standard ceramic laboratory filter, say -- creates a buildup of positive and negative charges. Tap into these charges with electrodes, and current will flow.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HYDROELECTRIC POWER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "From Vinyl to Digital, Hold the Crackle", "kicker": "BASICS"}, "snippet": "SEARCH the Gnutella Network as you may, some recordings are so scarce or of such limited appeal that you cannot find them anywhere, except maybe in your own vinyl collection.
