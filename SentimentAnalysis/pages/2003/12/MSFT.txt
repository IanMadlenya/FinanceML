Seen from the outside, the resulting cabin, top left, at just 352 square feet, suggests a friendly argument between a box and a half gable. A wood-frame living space, complete with a kitchen, is topped by a sloping roof that contains a sleeping loft. On the side facing the water and a garden, the box is clad in dark gray cement board and has 8-by-8-foot doors, top right, that can be fully opened; on the other sides, panels of galvanized steel offer privacy.

To that end, the finance ministry has cooperated with Sun Microsystems and I.B.M. in designing the Hebrew language version of OpenOffice software, a freely distributed open-source alternative to Microsoft Office.
