The Strokes take succinctness seriously. Their entire set lasted only an hour, with songs taking about three minutes each. The Strokes learned that brevity from punk rock, but they're not a punk band, even when their two guitars are strumming at top speed. With the strategic elegance of new-wave rock, the Strokes replace punk's monolithic drive with a meticulous examination of structure. From intro to final twist, each part needs a melodic germ and a musical treatment; the trick is to make each segment sound both surprising and inevitable. It's a feat that the Strokes accomplish in virtually every song.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "STROKES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 1522, "offset": 0, "time": 50}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
