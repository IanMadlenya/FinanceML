Cutting edge it's not, but the Affordable Art Fair is back for a second round with 50 more exhibitors than last year. Once more it promises a price limit of $5,000 and maybe a broader range of options. The number of mid-level New York galleries has grown and includes several photography dealers as well as print publishers; the rest come from the United States, Canada, Asia and the United Kingdom. Intended to be informal and informative and to attract beginning collectors -- and, it seems, artists -- the fair offers free lectures on contemporary art and printmaking and sculpture demonstrations. Hours: today and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7; under 16, free.
