Eric von Hippel, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argues that a huge swath of innovation can be traced to elite consumers whom he calls lead users. These imaginative and technically adept consumers spot a need and invent a solution, often changing whole industries, from sports to software. Mr. Von Hippel and his graduate students have compiled a series of case studies that fit his model of user innovation. Mountain biking, for example, began in the early 1970's when cyclists wanted to abandon paved roads for rough terrain. At the time, commercial bikes were not up to the task, so cyclists took heavy old bike frames with balloon tires and bolted on motorcycle-type lever-operated brakes for surer stops when careering down mountain trails. The industry spotted the trend, and mountain bike sales now account for more than half of the bike market in the United States.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER SOFTWARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONSUMER BEHAVIOR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEPHONES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Jamaica Fire Ruins 2 Stores And Displaces 9 Tenants"}, "snippet": "A fire tore through a two-story brick building in southeast Queens early yesterday, injuring no one but gutting two stores on the first floor and displacing nine men who rented rooms on the second floor.
