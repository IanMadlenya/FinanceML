They're the opposite of regional: they reflect the country of their origin to various degrees, but basically this is all universal music. 'Segundo' Juana Molina The Argentine television actress Juana Molina changed careers in the mid-90's to music and made one rock album before stumbling on the curious, lonely, misty dimensions of sound that you hear in ''Segundo'' (Domino), which is more or less a very high-functioning home recording. The album was originally finished in 2000, was released in Argentina first and has been out since the summer in the United States; she has already made a third album, as yet unavailable in America. Ms. Molina will perform on Wednesday night at Joe's Pub, and it will be interesting to see how much she has gone beyond ''Segundo.''", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Economy & Business; With Change in Consumer Confidence, So Goes the Presidency"}, "snippet": "A CHICKEN in every pot.

However, economic measures can clarify the health care picture as well as cloud it. One way for Americans to judge more easily the effectiveness of the new legislation, and of our health care system as a whole, is to adapt a leading tool of political economics: the misery index. Most people are familiar with the economic misery index, which is calculated by adding the percentage of Americans out of work to the general inflation rate. It was devised by Arthur Okun, an adviser to Jimmy Carter during the 1976 presidential election campaign, and was used to demonstrate how troubled the economy had become under President Gerald Ford. Okun felt that presenting inflation and unemployment figures separately did not give a very broad picture of the economy, because one indicator can rise while the other falls. Jointly rising unemployment and inflation, however, definitely make all people miserable.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE AND MANAGED CARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "DataBank; Stocks Have a Short but Happy Week"}, "snippet": "In a trading week shortened by Thanksgiving, the stock market climbed, prompted by a report indicating that the economy is growing even faster than expected.
