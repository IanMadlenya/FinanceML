So his company, renamed Silver Carrot, sent half a billion e-mail messages each month offering small prizes -- a box of Kraft macaroni and cheese or a Burger King Whopper -- to people who would register some personal information and agree to receive e-mail.

It's a multimedia music business now, and as video-era bands amass box-worthy archives, DVD's with video clips are beginning to take their place alongside hits, outtakes, rarities and live cuts. Here, the pop music critics of The New York Times review this year's boxed sets of three discs or more that include previously unreleased material. Sets that have already been reviewed in The Times, including Led Zeppelin's ''How the West Was Won'' and Miles Davis's ''In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk Complete,'' are not included. Prices are suggested retail. MILES DAVIS: 'THE COMPLETE JACK JOHNSON SESSIONS' -- (Columbia Legacy, five CD's, $69.98) Miles Davis was fascinated by Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone and searching for his own way to rock when he made ''A Tribute to Jack Johnson'' in 1970. His main strategy was to set up unswerving bass and drum foundations below volatile, aggressive, even vicious guitar and trumpet, sometimes adding unearthly keyboard sounds. Davis had his musicians vamp though one-chord shuffles, 12-bar blues and three-chord rock until the music began to seethe and snap. Then his producer, Teo Macero, cut and pasted the two long tracks of the original album, which complete the fifth disc. There's some wheel-spinning in this lengthy set. But the sessions reveal how grooves evolved from metronomic to funky, and they compel new admiration for the resourceful drumming of Billy Cobham and Jack DeJohnette and for John McLaughlin, who kept finding new ways to make his guitar slink around the rhythm or claw and shriek right through it.
