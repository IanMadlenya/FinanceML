Television viewers see the photographs and the home movies of birthdays and vacations again and again. And when there's an occasional happy ending, like Ms. Smart's safe return to her home last March, people who have never even met the victim can feel strong emotion. Television has recently taken note of the emotional identification that the public often feels about missing persons cases. Last fall CBS introduced ''Without a Trace,'' about a team of F.B.I. agents who investigate such disappearances. Now comes Lifetime's ''1-800-MISSING,'' which is not, as you might expect, a cheap copy of the CBS show. Actually this promising but wobbly new series, which has its premiere tomorrow night, seems to want to be the all-female ''X-Files.''", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "1-800-MISSING (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "REUBEN, GLORIA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FRESCO, MICHAEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "'American Pie' Reaches for a Wedding Cake", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "snippet": "''You know, I thought I'd outgrown this kind of behavior,'' Jim (Jason Biggs) says about halfway through ''American Wedding,'' at which point you're likely to feel the same way.

The sequel to ''American Pie'' and even more pathetically the sequel to ''American Pie 2,'' ''Wedding'' struggles so hard to be tasteless that it's almost quaint. (Don't presume such a remark to be a compliment; you'll see better film on ponds.) The key word in that sentence, however, is ''almost,'' which could also be appended to the noun ''movie.'' In a summer of sequels that included follow-ups to ''Charlie's Angels,'' ''The Terminator'' and ''Legally Blond,'' ''Wedding'' is so reiterative that it suggests the kind of compulsive behavior that often requires psychiatric counseling.
