The sequel to ''American Pie'' and even more pathetically the sequel to ''American Pie 2,'' ''Wedding'' struggles so hard to be tasteless that it's almost quaint. (Don't presume such a remark to be a compliment; you'll see better film on ponds.) The key word in that sentence, however, is ''almost,'' which could also be appended to the noun ''movie.'' In a summer of sequels that included follow-ups to ''Charlie's Angels,'' ''The Terminator'' and ''Legally Blond,'' ''Wedding'' is so reiterative that it suggests the kind of compulsive behavior that often requires psychiatric counseling. (What's next? ''Mayberry: C.S.I.''?)
