On the north shore, Nantucket town bustles with chowder houses, stately inns and art galleries. The town becomes a congested tangle in July and August as the island's population -- year-round and summer residents -- swells to 40,000 and is joined by tens of thousands of daily and weekly tourists. Visitors are discouraged from bringing cars to the narrow cobblestone roads, and parking is scarce. So leave your vehicle at the mainland ferry parking lot in Hyannis, Mass., and enjoy the island by bike. The bus is a convenient and affordable alternative. If you can sort through the barrage of overpriced, mediocre restaurants and look beyond the perpetually tanned 20-somethings in their parents' Land Rovers, Nantucket offers a lovely respite amid a wealth of natural beauty.
