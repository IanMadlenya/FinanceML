Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Now Playing ''BAD BOYS II,'' starring Martin Lawrence, Will Smith and Gabrielle Union. Directed by Michael Bay (R, 144 minutes). Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Smith return as a pair of Miami detectives, joined this time by Ms. Union, playing a federal agent who is also Mr. Lawrence's sister and Mr. Smith's love interest. The movie's unconscionable length is achieved by some extravagant car chases and a steady stream of gruesome violence, wearying profanity and narrative idiocy. Afterward you feel more beaten up than exhilarated, but the cast at least seems to be having some fun. The two main characters don't do anything new, but the homeboy psychobabble that punctuates their action-hero exertions gives this punishing, bombastic picture some moments of levity (A. O. Scott).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "REVLON LOSES MONEY FOR THE 19TH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER", "kicker": "COMPANY NEWS"}, "snippet": "Revlon Inc., the cosmetics maker, said yesterday that its second-quarter loss narrowed to $37.8 million as the company increased sales with new products and higher advertising spending.
