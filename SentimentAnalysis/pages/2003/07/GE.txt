Walter matched this wonderful musical pedigree with a true talent for teaching musical ideas, and an engaging, warm personality that endeared him to all those who had the privilege of working with him. With Walter's passing, we at the Met have lost one of our artistic treasures and dearest friend. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Lore, and his daughter, Lynn, and his many friends.
