But sadly, it was not to be. Instead of becoming one of the great series of the 70's, ''Savage'' (originally titled ''Watch Dog'') became the opposite of a rerun: it became a never ran. Produced by NBC as a two-hour pilot, ''Savage'' was relabeled a TV movie, burned off in a syndication package, then effectively banished from the TV landscape. The Watergate-tinged drama was considered too political for the network. In essence, it died from bad timing. But this week, ''Savage'' rises from the dead, just one of the fascinating TV zombies featured in Trio's series ''Brilliant but Cancelled.''", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 484, "offset": 0, "time": 83}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
