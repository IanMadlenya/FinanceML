His quintessential ad hominem attack title, ''Rush Limbaugh Is a Big, Fat Idiot,'' has already established his flair for the requisite games. Name calling, fact molding, gotcha!: all figure prominently in Mr. Franken's instant best seller ''Lies,'' just as they do in most of the books that ''Lies'' attacks.
