Most recently, a public service ad he did for GlaxoSmithKline became the centerpiece of an advertising blitz in magazines like Ebony and Savoy to focus attention on H.I.V. and prevention. The message was long overdue, and Mr. Johnson's celebrity and leadership status certainly make him a valuable spokesman. But within this image also lies what's wrong with the limited conversation on African-Americans and AIDS: women are not always a meaningful part of it. Black women make up less than 15 percent of the female population in the United States. But they represented 64 percent of all new AIDS cases among women in 2001, according to the federal government. Yet it is difficult to find any public campaign that focuses specifically on the prevention and treatment of black women. Magic Johnson may be a powerful symbol, but he cannot be expected to speak to the specific predicament of black women.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Ralph Steadman -- 'Who? Me!! No!!!

Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Now Playing * ''ABOUT SCHMIDT,'' starring Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates and Hope Davis. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 125 minutes). Mr. Nicholson's portrayal of Warren Schmidt, a retired insurance executive from Omaha at loose ends after the death of his wife, may be the most astonishing dramatic transformation of his 44-year screen career. Plodding in a weary, stiff-legged shuffle, this great actor reins in his bad-boy mannerisms to convey a deep, sorrowful awareness of human complexity. As the movie follows the attempts of this staid 66-year-old everyman to regain his equilibrium, it sustains an exquisite balance between a satire of Middle American life and the wrenching pathos of Warren's situation as he tries to form a bond with his resentful grown-up daughter (Ms. Davis) (Stephen Holden).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Goldman Makes More Cuts In Its Research Department"}, "snippet": "Goldman Sachs announced yesterday that it was paring its research staff, a sign that investment banks are taking further aim at stock research departments they regard as bloated.
