He is survived by Janet Stein, his beloved wife of 52 years, and by his five daughters and their families including his six granddaughters. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Howard worked in financial services, eventually joining The Dreyfus Corporation where he became chairman and CEO. With many innovations to his credit including some of the first money market and municipal bond funds as well as groundbreaking marketing and advertising strategies, Howard was considered one of the founders of the modern mutual fund industry. A quiet, even shy man of great vision, Howard was known for his keen intuition and his deep insight into the human spirit. He challenged those around him to reach beyond the traditional and the mundane and he insisted that complicated information be distilled into clear and concise ideas. His intense focus and determination helped turn those ideas into meaningful action. His remarkable sense of timing ensured that action was often taken at the perfect moment. Fascinated with the creative side of business, Howard had a lifelong interest in the arts and sciences. He was an avid gardener, spending many happy hours tending his seaside plantings on Long Island. He supported pioneering research in medicine. He came to love photography and assembled a notable collection spanning early masterworks and contemporary, experimental images. Howard's collection became the basis for his charitable foundation, Joy of Giving Something, Inc., which focuses on photography and video as an aid to education, social awareness and societal transformation. Over twenty years, Howard generously and selflessly helped to establish, support and nurture the careers of many artists in the field. Howard was an optimist who deeply believed in our ability to shape our future for the better. He inspired many around him to feel the same way. That may be his greatest legacy. He will be greatly missed by his family and his friends and associates. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Joy of Giving Something, Inc., 954 Lexington Avenue, Box #146, New York, NY 10021.
