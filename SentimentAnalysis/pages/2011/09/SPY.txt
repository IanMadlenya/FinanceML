Born on August 31, 1914 in Deal, New Jersey, and died September 30, 2011 at his home in New York City at the age of 97. He was graduated from The Choate School and from Harvard College, Magna cum Laude, Phi Beta Kappa. While at Harvard, he was published in \"The New Republic\" and had covered the coal mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, textile mill towns in the South and the drought in the dust bowls of the Midwest. He then became a junior foreign correspondent in London and the Balkans for Raymond Moley's Today magazine. After a stint at the London School of Economics, he became an editor of Life Magazine, when it was just a year old. His eleven years at Life were interrupted by four years in the Army. He volunteered for the infantry the day after the United States entered the war and served in Iceland, England, France, the Battle of the Bulge and Germany rising to the rank of captain. On his voyage home he wrote \"America's Germany\", which had been commissioned by Random House. Returning to Life Magazine for a few years, he left to become executive editor of True, then the world's largest men's magazine, and subsequently editor-in-chief of its sister magazine, Today's Woman. In the early sixties he formed The Julian Bach Literacy Agency with the help of Christopher Shaw, eventually representing some 500 primarily American and English authors. He loved music and was a devotee of concerts and the Metropolitan Opera. An enthusiastic traveler, he particularly liked hiking in the Swiss Alps. He attended virtually every Harvard varsity and freshman football game, both home and away until his mid eighties. His brief marriage to Kathryn Rains ended in divorce. In 1947, he married Halle Cowen (Schlesinger) who died in 1972. He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Hope Liberman (Harris), his daughter, Prudence Mortimer (Jay), his sister Doris Gordon, his stepson, Arthur (Tony) Cowen III (Edna), his stepdaughters, Alice Eberhardt (Ron), Audrey Matson (Marcus). He was predeceased by another stepdaughter, Halle (Jill) Cowen. He is also survived by seven grandchildren: Harriman Bach Mortimer, Jeffrey Cowen, Jane Cowen Hamilton, Eliza Cowen, Katherine Nintzel, Abigail Nintzel, Claire Matson and two great-grandchildren.
