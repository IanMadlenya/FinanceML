In 1956, he received his Master of Business Administration degree with distinction from The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. After college and prior to graduate school, Mr. Lubrano served in the US Army with the Military Police during the Korean conflict, where he was stationed in Seoul for which he received his combat infantry badge. He began his career as a certified public accountant for Arthur Anderson's Boston Office. He left the firm in 1968 and co-founded National Medical Care, a provider of kidney dialysis services, which ultimately went public and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. During the course of his 12 years of service at National Medical Care, Mr. Lubrano acted as Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Director of the firm. In 1980, Mr. Lubrano joined Apollo Computer Inc., one of the first vendors of graphical workstations that dominated the corporate landscape around Chelmsford, MA and helped establish Route 128 as the east coast challenger to California's Silicon Valley. He ultimatley served as its Chief Financial Officer. From 1980 to 1987, Apollo was the country's largest manufacturer of network workstations. Mr. Lubrano resigned from Apollo in 1986 to found his own venture capital firm, 21st Century Ventures Inc. Over decades, Mr. Lubrano served on the Board of Directors of numerous corporations including Staples Inc. and Bitstream Inc.

At the time of his death, Mr. Lubrano served on the Board of Trustees of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Mr. Lubrano was the son of the late Jack and Ruth Lubrano of Providence, RI. Before he was stricken by Mesothelioma in 2010, he fully intended to break their record for longevity (102 and 107 years, respectively.) He was predeceased by his wife of 43 years, Jean Hambleton Lubrano, with whom he raised a family of five. Mr. Lubrano resided in Hingham, MA; Bridgton, ME; and Vero Beach, FL. For a period of time in the mid-1980's, he was the co-owner of the Pleasant Mountain Ski Resort in Bridgton, Maine and helped install the mountain's first triple chair. He was an avid skier, hiker, camper, canoeist, golfer and tennis player. He had a great love of music and was a long-time supporter of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He married Jean Keyo of Hingham, MA in 2005, and the couple split their time between Massachusetts, Maine, and Florida. In his last years, Mr. Lubrano was happiest piloting his boat, The Satin Doll, on the waters of Moose Pond in Maine with his wife. Mr. Lubrano is survived by his wife, Jean Keyo Lubrano, and his five children: Beth Dwyer (Paul) of Pembroke, MA; Stacy Lamson (Timothy) of Amesbury, MA; Steven Lubrano (Allegra) of Hanover, NH; Jennifer Clayton (Mark) of Hingham, MA; Kathryn Robinson (Kenneth) of Providence, RI; and 11 grandchildren.
