(Ben), of Scottsdale, AZ, formerly of Islip and Glen Cove, NY, passed away peacefully on June 25th after a long illness. Born in Manhattan, New York, Ben worked in his father's Army/Navy store and developed an interest in photography. After distinguished service as a B-17 Radio Operator with the US Army Air Corps during WWII, Ben along with his brother Joe went on to found Calev Photolabs, Inc. Under Ben's leadership, the company would be a driving force in the wholesale photofinishing industry, and took pride in being New York City's first Kodacolor Lab. Having been a member of The Buck Rogers Group and President of the Photo Marketing Association International (PMAI) from 1983 - 1984, Ben helped to shape many of the photographic and marketing concepts taken for granted today. Ben is survived by his wife of over 60 years, Bea, son Andrew (Carol), grandchildren Ben (Erin) and Rebecca, great-grandchildren Emily and Anna, and sister Sylvia Gany of Tampa, Florida.
