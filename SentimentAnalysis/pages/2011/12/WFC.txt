Quogue, New York resident Dorothee C. Miller died on Tuesday, December 20 of cirrhosis of the liver at Stony Brook Medical Center after a five-week hospitalization. She was 78. Ms. Miller was the daughter of Sophie and Lester Cornelius. She grew up in Richmond Hill, NY and attended Jamaica High School, thereafter working variously at The Sperry Company and The Singer Company. She also worked part-time as a fashion and television model for The Harry Conover Agency and Pendleton. Later in life, she went back to school, receiving two Associate Degrees from Queens College, New York. She was predeceased in 1998 by her beloved husband of 21 years, Willie, as well as her cherished longtime companion Robert Lovett, Sr. of Hampton Bays, NY in 2008. Dorothee was always cheery and quick with a smile, generous in her hospitality, unwavering in her opinions, independent to the last, and she will be missed greatly by her family and many friends. Ms. Miller is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Joan and Richard Gibbs of Oak Creek, CO, her son and daughter-in-law, Todd and Lenore Evans of Remsenburg, NY, her son and daughter-in-law, Scott and Cynthia Evans of Chestertown, NY, and her grandchildren Alyssa, Cole, Casey, Kristin, Cody, and Jessie. According to Ms. Miller's wishes, there will be no funeral or memorial services. Her cremains will be scattered across Long Island Sound by her family. The family would appreciate that in lieu of flowers, a gift donation be made to The Betty Ford Legacy Fund in memory of Dorothee Miller, either online, or by calling 800-854-9211 x4105.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"seo": "Susan Galereave, Kiki Zeldes &mdash; Weddings", "main": "Susan Galereave and Kiki Zeldes", "print_headline": "Susan Galereave, Kiki Zeldes"}, "snippet": "A high school counselor and an editor marry in Massachusetts.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "A high school counselor and an editor marry in Massachusetts.", "keywords": [{"value": "Weddings and Engagements", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}]}, {"headline": {"seo": "After a Job Loss, Living Without Power or Prescriptions", "main": "Losing Her Job, Electricity and Prescriptions", "kicker": "The Neediest Cases", "print_headline": "Losing a Job, Electricity and Her Prescriptions", "content_kicker": "The Neediest Cases"}, "snippet": "When New York\u2019s OTB shut down, Ivonne Diaz had worked there 24 years and 4 months, falling just short of the 25-year minimum required to collect a pension.", "abstract": "Catholic Charities, one of the beneficiaries of the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, helps single mother Ivonne Diaz pay her electric bill after she loses her job of 25 years with the Off-Track Betting Corporation.", "lead_paragraph": "When New York\u2019s OTB shut down, Ivonne Diaz had worked there 24 years and 4 months, falling just short of the 25-year minimum required to collect a pension.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "Y", "value": "New York Times Neediest Cases Fund", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "value": "Philanthropy", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "value": "Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "4", "is_major": "N", "value": "Off-Track Betting Corp", "name": "organizations"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "F.D.A.
