The Officers, Board and Staff of Dramatists Play Service mourn the passing of our dear friend and client. We proudly publish and represent all of Lanford's plays, including the Pulitzer Prize winning Talley's Folly which is soon being revived on Broadway. Lanford was discovered in the 1960s at the beginning of the Off-Off and Off-Broadway movement by the legendary play agent Audrey Wood who recognized his unique ability to truthfully capture humanity in his writing which he displayed with love in all his characters. Lanford was one of the founding members of the famed Circle Repertory Company where many of his plays premiered and then quickly became staples of the American Theatre. From his short plays including the groundbreaking The Madness of Lady Bright, through Balm in Gillead and The Hot L Baltimore, and Talley's Folly and Burn This, we were always deeply moved by what Lanford wrote. Whether it's in a black box in Alphabet City, a university auditorium or a Broadway Theatre, Lanford will still be here with us. Dramatists Play Service, Inc.
