Bill was a resident of Coconut Grove, Florida and Quogue, New York. He was born and raised in Waterbury, CT. He attended McTernan's School, the Taft School, Yale College and Harvard Law School. During World War II, he flew 35 missions as a B-24 Pilot in the European Theater of Operations. He was awarded the Air Medal with two OLC's, the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart. After the war he attended Harvard Law School where he graduated cum laude and was an editor of the Law Review. He spent his entire professional career as a corporate lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell, in New York City, where he was a partner for over 30 years. He moved to Florida in 1996, but continued to summer in Quogue, NY, where he has summered for the last fifty years. He was a director of Americana Hotels & Realty Corp, Segue Software, Planned Parenthood of South Florida, and Community Partnership for the Homeless of Miami. Bill will be remembered as a wonderfully sweet man, always wearing a grin, whose kindness and generosity knew no bounds. He descended from the earliest settlers of the country on both sides of his family. His maternal ancestors included Thomas Hooker, the founder of Hartford, CT and Elihu Yale. His father's ancestors included two who fought in the Revolutionary War and the Battle of Brandywine and at the Battle of Plattsburg in the War of 1812. He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Irene Moullin, his two sons William A., Jr. and Robert M., and four grandchildren, Dillon, Caroline, Charlie and Sophia.
