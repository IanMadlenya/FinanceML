Conditioned as I am to peering under the surfaces of things and sussing out the dark truth, how am I to parse the enigma of transparency - the lack of discernible neuroses, the absence of characterological curveballs - that is Tory Burch? Despite her many roles as a ragingly successful business entrepreneur, divorced mother of three sons and devoted stepmother to three daughters, crack skier and tennis ace, adored friend, philanthropist, consummate hostess and general woman about town, she is disconcertingly all of a piece. There is - but how can this be? Can Dostoyevsky be all wrong? - no lurking secret self, no rattling skeletons. What you see, as God knows how many people have told me about her, ranging from her own mother to the society maven Billy Norwich, is what you get. And what you get, as far as I can tell, having spent some time with her and having talked to numerous people about her, is someone annoyingly close to perfect. Someone it would be nice to dislike, if she were only dislikable. Someone it's impossible not to envy, if only because her life seems sun drenched from the get-go, with a childhood that sounds near magical, spent climbing trees and romping with her brothers and the German shepherds her parents bred on a 35-acre gentleman's farm in Valley Forge, Pa., replete with tennis court and swimming pool.", "keywords": [{"value": "SoHo (NYC)", "name": "glocations", "rank": "4"}, {"value": "Fashion and Apparel", "name": "subject", "rank": "3"}, {"value": "Burch, Tory", "name": "persons", "rank": "2"}, {"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "For Wall Street Watchdog, All Grunt Work, Little Glory", "kicker": "DealBook", "print_headline": "For Wall Street Watchdog, All Grunt Work, Little Glory"}, "snippet": "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has quietly built a fledgling fraud task force that has entered the front lines in fighting insider trading.", "abstract": "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has quietly built a fledgling fraud task force that has entered the front lines in fighting insider trading.", "lead_paragraph": null, "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "For Wall Street Watchdog, All Grunt Work, Little Glory", "kicker": "DealBook"}, "snippet": "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has quietly built a fledgling fraud task force that has entered the front lines to fight insider trading.", "abstract": "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has quietly built a fledgling fraud task force that has entered the front lines to fight insider trading.", "lead_paragraph": "ROCKVILLE, Md. - Last week, when a former Boston Red Sox infielder faced accusations of insider trading, the Securities and Exchange Commission got credit for levying a $100,000 fine.
