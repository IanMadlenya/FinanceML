The White House said it would release emergency oil stockpiles to meet shortages and would relax environmental standards nationwide.

[C3.] Hedge Fund Company's Brokerage Arm Draws Attention Over the last two and a half years, Bayou Securities, the brokerage unit of Bayou Group, the Connecticut hedge fund company at the center of a growing investigation, generated $51.5 million in revenue executing trades for its four affiliated hedge funds. Such revenues seem excessive for a small firm like Bayou, hedge fund experts said.
