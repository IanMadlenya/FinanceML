That people find them amusing usually tells us something about reality.

The White House said it would release emergency oil stockpiles to meet shortages and would relax environmental standards nationwide. [Page A1.] After one of the worst storms ever to hit the Gulf Coast, large parts of the nation's distribution system had shut down, slowing down imports and exports. One result could be that American consumers will be paying more for everything from coffee and bananas to paint and tires. [C1.] From as far away as Massachusetts and Ohio, convoys of utility trucks and reinforcement workers are descending on the storm-damaged region to restore electricity to the estimated 1.7 million household and business customers still without power.

The account shift is one of the largest in advertising in recent years. Interpublic has been plagued by financial and operational problems since 2002. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C3.] Hedge Fund Company's Brokerage Arm Draws Attention Over the last two and a half years, Bayou Securities, the brokerage unit of Bayou Group, the Connecticut hedge fund company at the center of a growing investigation, generated $51.5 million in revenue executing trades for its four affiliated hedge funds. Such revenues seem excessive for a small firm like Bayou, hedge fund experts said. [C1.] Stocks Climb After Fed Official Comments on Rates Stocks climbed yesterday, rising after the president of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve signaled that the central bank could change its interest rate policy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Falling oil prices also helped stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.78 points, to 10,481.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.92 points, to 1,220.33, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 22.33 points, to 2,152.09.

Approves Drug for Children's Growth The Food and Drug Administration gave approval to the first new drug in 30 years for the treatment of abnormally short stature in children. It is the first drug approved for Tercica, a biotechnology company based in Brisbane, Calif. An estimated 6,000 children in this country have the specific condition for which the F.D.A. approved the drug, although some doctors expect it to be more broadly prescribed to children with less severe growth abnormalities. [C5.] As health officials worked to avoid another flu vaccine shortage like that in the 2004-5 season, regulators approved a flu shot from GlaxoSmithKline, and a Chiron vaccine plant in Liverpool that was shut last year because of contamination moved closer to being opened. [C5.] Google Moves Offline, Into Print Google, which built a lucrative business in online advertising, is buying ad space in magazines and filling it with half a dozen ads from clients of its vast online system.
