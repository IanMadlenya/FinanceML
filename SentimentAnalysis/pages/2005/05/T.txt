Joan enjoyed an illustrious 45 years career in production and the arts in New York City. She began at Grey Advertising Agency creating commercials for Good Humor. She moved on to the Kudner Advertising Agency where she worked as production assistant on the Milton Berle Show, and other popular shows at the time. From 1953-1958 she worked as a production assistant with Jackie Gleason Enterprises. She frequently regaled audiences with tales about ''Jackie, Art, Audrey and Joyce on and off the set.'' From 1959 through 1964 Joan assisted in the production and direction of the Robert Q. Lewis show, the Jimmy Rogers show and the Kate Smith show. She was also the managing agent for Art Carney, Mary Martin, James Mason, and others through her work with the McCaffrey Talent Agency. Joan's best work was as Director of Special Projects at the Lincoln Center Library and Museum of the Performing Arts. From Jackie Onassis to Robin Williams, she engaged, and entertained through screenings of all major studios, receptions and galas, and Amsterdam Gallery openings and exhibits. Joan was a vivacious and endearing person whose love and legacy touched multiple generations. From trips to Ireland with her dear friend Maureen O'Hara to St. Patrick's Day parties with her buddies at Neary's she lived life to the fullest. She is survived by her nieces Diane Heller Klein of Pittsburgh and Karen Heller of Las Vegas; her nephew Aaron Heller of Reno, her brother-in-law Daniel B. Heller of Pittsburgh, and her cousins Rita J. Gould of Pittsburgh and Sally Gould of San Francisco. She is also survived by loving grandnieces and nephews.
