As you plow through the crowds and rustle through the greens, you might want a little help focusing. Here it is. These purveyors at local farmers' markets are among the best. Most bring crops to market month after month. But each has a specialty worth trying at the peak of its season. For each, the tale of what brought them to market is slightly different. Exact market locations and times are at www.cenyc.org, www.nyfarmersmarket.com and www.communitymarkets.biz. Italian Seeds That Flourished in New York Soil Ken Migliorelli's grandfather Rocco brought broccoli rabe seeds with him when he immigrated from the Lazio region of Italy, and planted them at the family's first farm, in the Bronx. ''In 1933, where Co-op City is now, it was all farmland,'' said Mr. Migliorelli, who now farms about 300 acres in Tivoli, N.Y. ''We lost that farm, but my dad brought the seeds upstate and I'm still growing exactly the same strain as my grandfather did.'' Dark, pungent broccoli rabe is not a kind of broccoli -- it's more closely related to the turnip (the Italian term is cime di rape, meaning turnip tops). AVAILABLE -- Will be in markets in July, then absent for August and back again after Labor Day. (Broccoli rabe dislikes very hot weather.) SELECTING -- Not all broccoli rabe has florets. Look for perky, dark green stems and leaves. Yellow flowers connote freshness, but yellow leaves are a sign of age. STORING -- Lasts well but does not improve in the refrigerator. ''The sooner you cook it, the less bitter it is,'' Mr. Migliorelli says. KITCHEN TIP -- In the Migliorelli family, broccoli rabe is always cooked for at least 20 or 30 minutes. ''Coat the bottom of a pot with oil, add a couple of minced garlic cloves and let it simmer. Then add the wet broccoli, cover the pot, and cook it down until it's soft. It should never be al dente.'' FIND THEM -- Saturdays at 110th Street and Manhattan Avenue; Thursdays at 175th Street; Tuesdays and Thursdays at the downtown PATH station; Thursdays and Fridays at Rockefeller Center; Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at Union Square; Tuesdays at Yankee Stadium; and Saturdays at Atlas Park and Wednesdays at Astoria, both in Queens.
