Joan enjoyed an illustrious 45 years career in production and the arts in New York City. She began at Grey Advertising Agency creating commercials for Good Humor.

She was also the managing agent for Art Carney, Mary Martin, James Mason, and others through her work with the McCaffrey Talent Agency. Joan's best work was as Director of Special Projects at the Lincoln Center Library and Museum of the Performing Arts. From Jackie Onassis to Robin Williams, she engaged, and entertained through screenings of all major studios, receptions and galas, and Amsterdam Gallery openings and exhibits.
