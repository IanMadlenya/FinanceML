Even one of its producers, the superstar Will Smith, calls the movie ''perfectly bizarre'' in its twists, on-screen and off. Indeed, ''Saving Face'' owes its existence to the vagaries of business planning at Microsoft, to new assertiveness in the Chinese-American film world, and to a helicopter soaring above Manhattan for the $70 million Sony Pictures blockbuster ''Hitch.''

(His colleague Bill Gates owns the compound next door.) Mr. Raikes bought the beloved but run-down resort in 2001. Since it first opened in 1913, Alderbrook has been a vacation spot for Seattle and Tacoma families. The resort's face lift, by the Seattle architect Dan Foltz, is neo-Craftsman. Its materials, colors and detailing inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, the turn-of-the-century school of design that emphasized simplicity and natural materials. In the lobby, a stone fireplace reaches to the 30-foot-high ceiling, 20 peeled logs support the beams and the huge windows overlook the natural, Northwest-style landscaped courtyard and the canal beyond. Alderbrook has a gabled roof, lots of wood and stone, and shades of brown and green that blend with the resort's forested and mountainous environment. But it's a Northwest vacation lodge with big-city amenities, including a full-service spa, a 55-foot heated glass-enclosed swimming pool, and a whirlpool. Guests receive preferred tee times at the neighboring 18-hole Alderbrook Golf and Yacht Club. The Restaurant at Alderbrook (run by Tom Black, an award-winning chef) serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. THE LOCATION -- Alderbrook is just down State Road 106 past Union (pop. 345) on the 70-mile-long Puget Sound inlet known as the Hood Canal. It's about two hours by ferry and car from Seattle, about 20 minutes by seaplane. In Union and at the resort, you can rent a kayak from Kayak Hood Canal (www.kayakhoodcanal.com) for a closer look at the canal's harbor seals, bald eagles, ospreys, great blue herons, otters and salmon. THE ROOMS -- All 77 rooms have cozy window seats and balconies or patios for enjoying views either of the canal or of the Olympic Mountains to the west. Each room also offers free high-speed Internet access, down comforters and French press coffee. Framed photos from Alderbrook family vacations of yore, provided by guests, hang on the walls. The 15 remodeled cottages, arranged in a horseshoe next to the lodge, have one or two bedrooms, fireplaces and fully furnished kitchens. Grocery delivery from the lodge can be arranged. THE BATHROOMS -- Green-tiled walls surround deep and roomy oval soaking tubs. There are large showers, with dispensers of Molton Brown bath products. THE CROWD -- On a sunny summer afternoon last year, a group of people in their 20's played badminton on the lawn and a family frolicked in the pool as an elderly couple sipped wine in Adirondack chairs and watched kayakers paddle by. Sometimes, celebrities visiting Mr. Gates dine in the two-tiered restaurant with its spectacular water view. ROOM SERVICE -- Selections from the restaurant's breakfast, lunch and dinner menus are available, but room service ends at 9 p.m. The menu is seasonal and features local produce and seafood. Popular choices are oyster po' boy sandwich ($10), Dungeness crab macaroni and cheese ($12), and Hood Canal cioppino ($22), made with local clams, mussels, oysters, salmon and prawns. THE BOTTOM LINE -- Alderbrook had a perfect location when its renovation began. Now it's a luxurious, yet remote, getaway. Summer season room rates begin at $160 a person, double occupancy, for a room with limited views; a marina-view suite goes for up to $310. Cottages start at $180; a two-bedroom waterfront cottage costs as much as $450.
