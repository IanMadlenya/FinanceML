Tycoons and executives dined in aeries. While everyone else ate at ground-level restaurants and coffee shops, or brown-bagged a few floors up in the stockroom, the captains of industry, whisked through the streets in their limos, ascended by elevators to private redoubts at the tops of skyscrapers. There, looking down on the city spread out below them, they drank their tycoon-size martinis, smoked cigars and ordered executive comfort food: Dover sole, say, and a slice of melon trucked in from upstate. These lofty retreats are mostly gone now, but in the heyday of skyscraper lunching they included the Rockefeller Center Club, on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza; the Hemisphere Club and Tower Suite, on the 48th floor of the Time-Life Building; the Pinnacle Club, near the top of the 45-story Socony-Mobil Building; and the Sky Club, on the 56th floor of the Pan Am Building. The oldest of them, and the inspiration for many of the others, was the romantically named Cloud Club, which occupied the 66th, 67th and 68th floors of the Chrysler Building and opened its padded leather doors in July 1930 to a membership of 300 movers and shakers, including E.F.
