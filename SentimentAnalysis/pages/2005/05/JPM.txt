Italian Seeds That Flourished in New York Soil Ken Migliorelli's grandfather Rocco brought broccoli rabe seeds with him when he immigrated from the Lazio region of Italy, and planted them at the family's first farm, in the Bronx. ''In 1933, where Co-op City is now, it was all farmland,'' said Mr. Migliorelli, who now farms about 300 acres in Tivoli, N.Y. ''We lost that farm, but my dad brought the seeds upstate and I'm still growing exactly the same strain as my grandfather did.'' Dark, pungent broccoli rabe is not a kind of broccoli -- it's more closely related to the turnip (the Italian term is cime di rape, meaning turnip tops). AVAILABLE -- Will be in markets in July, then absent for August and back again after Labor Day. (Broccoli rabe dislikes very hot weather.) SELECTING -- Not all broccoli rabe has florets. Look for perky, dark green stems and leaves. Yellow flowers connote freshness, but yellow leaves are a sign of age. STORING -- Lasts well but does not improve in the refrigerator. ''The sooner you cook it, the less bitter it is,'' Mr. Migliorelli says. KITCHEN TIP -- In the Migliorelli family, broccoli rabe is always cooked for at least 20 or 30 minutes. ''Coat the bottom of a pot with oil, add a couple of minced garlic cloves and let it simmer. Then add the wet broccoli, cover the pot, and cook it down until it's soft. It should never be al dente.''

New Jersey Produce With Korean Parents Nevia No left South Korea when she was a child and never expected to become a farmer, but she found her niche as a grower of Asian vegetables -- like avocado squash, Chinese long beans, edamame and chili peppers. She and her former husband, Kwang Yoo, tend a 90-acre farm in Bordentown, N.J., where she experiments with new vegetables grown from imported Korean seeds. ''You have to watch the shoots, the bud, the leaves, the tops, at every step,'' she said. Her many Asian-American regulars come for herbs like red shiso and greens like tatsoi, but her greatest expertise is in cucumber varieties. ''The Korean cucumbers are crispier, the Japanese ones are juicier, the lemon ones are round and sweet, and the Armenian ones have the thinnest skins,'' she said. AVAILABLE -- Asparagus, herbs, cucumbers and greens are in now. After July 4, squash, beans and peppers will appear. SELECTING -- ''When you can see tiny spikes on the cucumbers, that's a sign of freshness,'' she said. ''They rub off under running water.'' STORING -- Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate. KITCHEN TIP -- ''Mixing different varieties makes the best salad,'' she said. ''And all Asian cucumbers make good pickles, because they have thinner skins.'' FIND THEM -- Saturdays at Abingdon Square and Lincoln Center, and at Cortelyou Road, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn; Mondays and Fridays at Union Square; Wednesdays at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza.

Filmmakers have long been fascinated with prostitution, not only because of the profession's metaphoric resonance (see the films of Jean-Luc Godard, ad infinitum), but also because woman's work just isn't very interesting if it doesn't involve sex and the possibility that the woman on screen might be stripped of her clothes and perhaps her humanity. In the Israeli film ''Or,'' about a prostitute and her teenage daughter, both clothes and humanity are stripped away with impunity.
