The burning question of the moment, however, is whether the governors who applauded Mr. Gates in Washington will revert to the bad old status quo once they get home. The tendency among the states to embrace the lowest common denominator in education has been especially evident since Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which required the states to place a ''highly qualified teacher'' in every classroom and administer yearly tests in the early grades with the aim of closing the achievement gap between rich and poor students.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GATES, BILL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STATES (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REFORM AND REORGANIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAXATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GOVERNORS (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Technology Briefing | Deals: Ubisoft In Deal With A Golfer"}, "snippet": "Ubisoft Entertainment said yesterday that it planned to start developing sports video games, a genre dominated by a rival game publisher, Electronic Arts Inc.
