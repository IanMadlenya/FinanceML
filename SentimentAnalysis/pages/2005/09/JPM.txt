Karl Lagerfeld set Fendi on a fresh course with some of the prettiest clothes of the season -- and that's clothes, not furs or bags. At the opposite extreme, Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce, celebrating their 20th year in fashion, unwittingly exposed the price of success. Fendi has struggled to find a new identity under LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, but in the end, it was the house's long-time designer, Mr. Lagerfeld, who came up the perfect solution: a collection of pristine white blouses and shapely, cummerbund-waist black skirts that demonstrated the power of design. Though the Fauvist palette included electric blue and tomato red, often in watery abstract prints, the black and white pieces -- sometimes trimmed with laser-cut plastic lace -- conveyed the modernity of Mr. Lagerfeld's proportions. Clothes have long played second fiddle to Fendi's furs and accessories, but the new fashion polish suggests that Fendi's management intends to see the brand as a whole.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "LAGERFELD, KARL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DOLCE & GABBANA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FENDI"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRESSES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Journalists Fear Impact On Protecting Sources"}, "snippet": "Some lawyers and journalists said the claim by journalists that they have the right to protect confidential sources had been weakened.", "abstract": "Lawyers and journalists debate long-term legal consequences of New York Times reporter Judith Miller's decision to testify before grand jury after spending 85 days in jail for refusing to do so; some expect journalists' right to protect confidential sources is weaker and that prosecutors will be more aggressive; others are uncertain of long-term impact and predict confidential sources will be just as forthcoming (M)", "lead_paragraph": "The decision by Judith Miller, a reporter for The New York Times, to testify before a grand jury after spending 85 days in jail for refusing to do so has left many people who are interested in the case confused and eager for more details.
