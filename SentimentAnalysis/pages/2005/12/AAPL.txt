This kitchen lacked some of the polish and care it took with preparations a few years ago, but nothing was amiss with a carpaccio of salmon and tuna, the translucent squares of pale tuna and pink salmon arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Crisp pear, ginger and lime cut deliciously the butteriness of the fish.
