Last week, one software designer described a new version of a peer-to-peer file-sharing system that he says will make it easier to share digital information anonymously and make detection by corporations and governments far more difficult. Others have described similar efforts. The issue is complicated by the fact that the small group of technologists designing the new systems say their goal is to create tools to circumvent censorship and political repression -- not to abet copyright violation. [C1.] Behind Murdoch Departure, a Family Rift The sudden exit of Rupert Murdoch's elder son Lachlan from his job at the News Corporation came amid family tensions, people close to the Murdochs said; the chief issue is said to have been Lachlan's feeling that his father interfered in his business dealings and undermined him. [C1.] Creating Movie Theaters for Multilingual Audiences Moctesuma Esparza, left, a film and television producer, just opened the first megaplex of the Maya Cinemas theater chain he dreamed up five years ago to serve the growing number of Latino moviegoers. Mr. Esparza says Latino audiences ''want to see movies where they get to see themselves.'' Mr. Esparza has big expansion plans for the chain; by next year, he expects to add new multiplexes, totaling 65 screens, in Bakersfield and Inglewood, Calif., and in Santa Fe and Santa Ana Pueblo, N.M. In each theater, one or two screens will be set aside for showing Spanish-language or other foreign and independent films.

[C1.] Publishers Issue Guidelines on Reporters' Notes News organizations are trying to outwit a new generation of prosecutors and protect reporters and sources in what they believe to be a more antagonistic environment. In some cases, news executives are issuing guidelines to educate and re-educate their staffs about precautions to protect their notes and other source materials from being sought as evidence in legal cases. [C1.] Growth or Value? Media Stocks Seem to Be Neither Media companies, once hot growth stocks, are facing a long-term future of slower revenue that may make them more appealing to value and income investors. But some industry observers argue that they are not behaving enough like value or income stocks, which are often characterized by robust dividends and stock buyback programs. [C1.] Behind DreamWorks Talks, Two Powerful Men For many in Hollywood last week, the news that NBC Universal was in talks to acquire DreamWorks SKG was unexpected. But what was no surprise was that two Hollywood power players were at the center of it: Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, and David Geffen, the billionaire music impresario who helped co-found DreamWorks. [C4.] Site Aims to Find Fastest Route Between Two Points Chinedu Echeruo, left, of New York has started a Web site, HopStop.com, that he says will so simplify the world of mass transit that advertisers, Internet search engines and transit agencies will eventually clamor to use and buy ads on the site. He says the site has processed more than a million requests so far this year and averages about 150,000 users a month. HopStop users type addresses, landmarks or businesses into origin and destination fields. Based on criteria set by the user, the site determines the quickest and most convenient pathway through New York's expansive mass transit system.

He was a well-respected resident and attorney of Peekskill, New York. He graduated New York University Law School in 1928 and began practicing law. He started his law career at Pines and Sterling, a leading firm in Peekskill, where his starting salary was $5 per week. He practiced until 1970 when he formed a partnership, Hersh and Hersh P.C., with his sons, which is still carried on by his son, Robert, at the old County Trust Bank Building located on Central Avenue in Peekskill. Never afraid of hard work, Ben was at the office every day well past his 90th birthday. An accomplished attorney, Ben was at times, Counsel to Peekskill Hospital, Counsel to the Mohegan Fire District, and Counsel to Caring for the Homeless of Peekskill. He served as Special Counsel to the Town of Cortlandt and was a Trustee of The Security Title Company. He served a term as director of the YWCA, although, as he put it, he was neither young, nor a woman, nor Christian. In the sixties, he served as closing attorney for Chase Manhattan Bank. During the term of Peekskill mayor Michael J. Dibart, Ben served as Prosecutor for the City of Peekskill. He was also elected to the Board of Directors for the Westchester County National Bank. While still a student at Columbia Law School, Governor George Pataki clerked for Ben Hersh and got his first experience in the practice of law. Ben was a longtime friend of the Pataki family, and represented the Governor's father, and grandfather. Two of his siblings followed Ben into the practice of law; Jerome and Frederick. So did his two sons, Robert and Philip as well as three of his nephews, Eric, John, and Scot. All continue to practice on the same street in Peekskill, except for Eric who is deceased. The legacy of attorneys seems to be continuing as Ben's granddaughter, Sarah, graduated Denver Law School in May 2005. An active member of the First Hebrew Congregation, Ben Hersh served three terms as president. As Chairman of the Building Committee, he was instrumental in the property acquisition and construction of the First Hebrew's Rt. 6 Building in Peekskill. He was the beloved husband of Anita Joseph for 58 years. Devoted father to Philip and Robert and cherished grandfather of Jenn, Sarah, Vicki, Jeff, Zack and Becky. He was the devoted father-in-law to Patrice; brother to Esther, Fredrick and Jerome, uncle to Scot, John, Richard, Anne, Todd, Baron, Miriam, and Nicole. A service was held at the First Hebrew Congregation on Monday morning. 350 people attended. In lieu of flowers, the family has suggested donations to the First Hebrew Congregation of Peekskill. <br><center><img src=\"http://graphics.nytimes.com/logos/06021100.GIF\"></center>", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  Talbert, Alfred A."}, "snippet": "TALBERT-Alfred A. 85, died on July 20.
