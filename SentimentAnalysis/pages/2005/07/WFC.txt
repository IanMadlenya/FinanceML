We were to evaluate samples from each bottle for appearance, odor, flavor, mouth, feel and aftertaste -- and our aim was to identify the interloper among the famous names. One of our bottles had been filled from the tap. Would we spot it? We worked our way through the samples, writing scores for each one.

Last week, one software designer described a new version of a peer-to-peer file-sharing system that he says will make it easier to share digital information anonymously and make detection by corporations and governments far more difficult. Others have described similar efforts. The issue is complicated by the fact that the small group of technologists designing the new systems say their goal is to create tools to circumvent censorship and political repression -- not to abet copyright violation.

Mr. Esparza has big expansion plans for the chain; by next year, he expects to add new multiplexes, totaling 65 screens, in Bakersfield and Inglewood, Calif., and in Santa Fe and Santa Ana Pueblo, N.M. In each theater, one or two screens will be set aside for showing Spanish-language or other foreign and independent films.
