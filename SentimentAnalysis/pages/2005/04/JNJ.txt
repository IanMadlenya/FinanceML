Working in a part of the country all too few East and West Coasters associate with opera, the company, situated in Indianola, 12 miles south of Des Moines, has been mounting quality productions with young professionals (like Lauren Flanigan before she became famous) for more than 30 years. The theater may be small (488 seats), but the repertory is not: where many small regional companies favor musicals and light opera, this group's past repertory runs to things like ''Aida'' and Strauss's ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' Critics have reacted with accolades: in The Chicago Tribune in 1999, Lawrence A. Johnson called the company's production of ''Street Scene'' by Kurt Weill ''my single most memorable event of the year,'' while Brian Kellow of ''Opera News'' described the 2002 season as something ''any company could be proud of.'' Part of the success is attributed to the scrupulous attention to detail of the founding artistic director, Robert L. Larsen. This summer's three productions, taking place from June 24 to July 17, give a good sense of the company's programming, with two works that are familiar but by no means easy, Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' and Offenbach's ''Tales of Hoffmann'' (Dean Elzinga, a bass-baritone familiar from City Opera, plays the villains) and one rarely performed English-language opera, Britten's wonderful and underrated ''Gloriana.''

It was the first element in what Mr. Wilson announced would be a 10-play cycle about the African-American experience in the 20th century, each play set in a different decade. (''Jitney'' was written earlier but at that time had been produced only in Pittsburgh.)
