Merck Distinguished Senior Scientist, died April 20, 2005 at the age of 79, in Grenada. Dr. Fisher joined Merck &amp; Co., Inc. in 1957. During Dr. Fisher's distinguished 47 years at Merck, he had been associated with numerous successful programs, but he was always particularly proud of his involvement in the discovery of ivermectin, the active ingredient in HEARTGARD, IVOMEC, MECTIZAN and STROMECTOL. Through these medicines, millions of pets and livestock have been able to live healthy, parasite-free lives and more than 40 million people are protected each year from the tropical disease river blindness. Dr. Fisher made a major contribution to medicine and to the quality of life. He is survived by his son Jeffrey, daughterin-law Debra, daughter Susan &amp; grandchildren Samuel Fisher, William Fisher and Sarah Stasium. His beloved wife Elsa died in 1994. He was born March 16, 1926, in Manchester England, to Herbert &amp; Mabel Fisher.
