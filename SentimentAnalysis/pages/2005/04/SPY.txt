Head first to the STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM (144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500) for ''AFRO MUSES'': a selection of delirious watercolors by the British artist CHRIS OFILI, of imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, ornate, in deep, swimmy colors. Then check out 303 GALLERY in Chelsea (525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255 - 1121), where TIM GARDNER's hypnotically creepy photorealist pastels (a switch for him from watercolors) are based on late 1970's photographs of his own middle-class family, with their period hairdos and put-on smiles. Starting Friday, two CHUCK CLOSE portraits are in view at SOTHEBY'S (72nd Street and York Avenue, (212)606-7000). ''JOHN'' from 1971-72, and ''ERIC,'' 1990 (of the painter ERIC FISCHL), go on the block next week, so this may be the last chance to see them before they end up above some millionaire's sofa. And there are two permanent collection surveys of portraiture. At the INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY (Sixth Avenue at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000) are recent acquisitions by IRVING PENN, SUSAN MEISELAS, ROBERT CAPA, MALICK SIDIB\u00c9 and KATY GRANNAN. The AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM (45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040), meanwhile, surveys a range of folk portraitists including ACHILLES G. RIZZOLI (1896-1981), an architectural draftsman, who was so devoted to his mother that he slept at the foot of her bed until she died in 1937, the year he drew her as a large Gothic cathedral.
