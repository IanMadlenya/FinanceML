Bruno, the State Senate's majority leader, to press Ms. Pirro to run for state attorney general instead. But other Republicans warned that any switch by Ms. Pirro might alienate some county leaders who could retaliate by working against her.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ATTORNEYS GENERAL"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  Vogel, Frederic B."}, "snippet": "VOGEL-Frederic B.
