Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. Broadway 'ABSURD PERSON SINGULAR' An uninspired revival of Alan Ayckbourn's classic farce of marital misery and Christmas cheerlessness, directed by John Tillinger. The largely merely serviceable cast includes Paxton Whithead, Mireille Enos and the wonderful Deborah Rush, who sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s of playing drunk in splendid comic style (2:30). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley). 'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'IN MY LIFE' Joseph Brooks's whimsical musical about heaven and earth works grotesquely hard to disguise its conventional heart. Mostly, it's like drowning in a singing sea of syrup (1:45). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped biomusical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a storyline poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). The August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Could it be that the exhaustingly prolific Richard Greenberg has been even busier than anyone suspected? This clunky farce about the limits of liberalism, directed by Doug Hughes and starring a miscast Richard Thomas and Jill Clayburgh, suggests that Mr. Greenberg has been moonlighting as a gag writer for sitcoms and is now recycling his discarded one-liners (1:45). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prize winner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp and at over two hours, it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) * 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) Off Broadway 'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200.(Neil Genzlinger) * 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood) 'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Jason Zinoman) 'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder) 'FIVE COURSE LOVE' This musical is merely pleasantly fluffy, and sometimes offensive, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100.(Genzlinger) * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE GREAT AMERICAN TRAILER PARK MUSICAL' A terrific cast keeps the generator running in this bright but flimsy contraption. A few of David Nehls's dozen ditties raise a hearty chuckle, like the valedictory anthem in which the show's heroines collectively vow to ''make like a nail and press on.'' But Betsy Kelso's book all but dispenses with plot, and substitutes crude cartoons for characters (2:00). Dodger Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'HAMLET' Michael Cumpsty gives a forceful, intelligent reading of the title role in the Classic Stage Company's likably intimate production of Shakespeare's tale of doom-struck Danes. Brian Kulick's production is heavy on the directorial gimmickry (smell the spray paint! watch the set be shredded!), leaving psychology and philosophy to fend for themselves (2:30). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'HILDA' Marie Ndiaye's play is a psychodrama from which most of the psychology seems to have mysteriously evaporated, taking a lot of the drama with it. Ellen Karas stars as a bourgeois housewife whose obsession with her maid eventually unhinges her (1:20). Part of the Act French Festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood) 'IN THE AIR' Historical melodrama about the 1918 flu epidemic is like a soft-focus film on the Lifetime channel (2:15). Theater 315, 315 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman) 'JUNIE B. JONES' A spirited entertainment (1:30). Theaterworks/NYC, at the Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200. (Van Gelder) 'MEDEA' The Jean Cocteau Repertory's clich\u00e9-ridden modern translation strains to be relevant (1:30). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 the Bowery, near East Second Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman) 'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4-year-old. Unfortunately Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood) 'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) * 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder) 'RFK' This solo show written and starring Jack Holmes is a reasonably accurate historical portrait, but the performance, unfortunately, lacks the charisma and charm that made the real Bobby Kennedy a star (1:35). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 253-9983. (Jonathan Kalb) 'THE RUBY SUNRISE' Rinne Groff's period drama explores the country's growing pains during the early years of television. Directed by the new Public Theater chief Oskar Eustis, the play casts glancing looks at a large subject, namely the country's failure to harness advances in technology to socially progressive ends. But it is essentially a deftly structured but heavy-treading drama about the dashed dreams and tarnished ideals of two generations of spirited Midwestern women (2:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'SEE WHAT I WANNA TO SEE' A hot-and-cold chamber musical by Michael John LaChiusa, based on stories by Ryuonsoke Akutagawa, that considers the nature of truth and belief. The show's film-noir-style first half is more chilly than chilling. But its second act, set in the shadow of 9/11, throbs affectingly with a hunger for faith. With Idina Menzel and Marc Kudisch (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THIRD' Heidi is having hot flashes. In this thoughtful, seriously imbalanced comedy, Wendy Wasserstein takes her archetypal heroine (most famously embodied in 1988 in ''The Heidi Chronicles'') into the fog of menopausal, existential uncertainty. The wonderful but miscast Dianne Weist plays a feminist college professor forced to reconsider everything she stands for. Though Daniel Sullivan's staging is too easygoing to build tension, the play exhales a poignant air of autumnal rue (2:00). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'WAITING FOR GODOT' (2:30). In this solid production, it is Sam Coppola (Vladimir) and Joseph Ragno (Estragon) who are waiting for the world's most famous no-show. It's been 50 years since Samuel Beckett's play was first staged on Broadway, and the changes in the world since then give the never-changing world of Didi and Gogo some interesting new resonance. Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton,(212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) Off Off Broadway 'BELLY OF A DRUNKEN PIANO' In this splendidly imperfect cabaret, Stewart D'Arrietta howls and growls convincingly through Tom Waits's three-decade song catalog, backed by a snappy trio. His patter and his piano playing are variable, but Mr. D'Arrietta makes a genial tour guide through Mr. Waits's wee-hours world (1:45). Huron Club at SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Varick Street, (212) 691-1555. (Rob Kendt) 'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder) 'BROKEN JOURNEY' A gripping production of a modern-day rendering of ''Rashomon'' by a British poet and playwright who employs clever wordplay to define the characters and delve into their psyche. A solid cast manages to hold the tension taut for most of the 110 minutes. Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Wilborn Hampton) 'PAUL ROBESON' Paul Robeson's voice remains his most enduring legacy, so it makes sense to cast Phillip Hayes Dean's play about him with an opera singer. Kevin Maynor, a resonant bass, gets some of the impact of Robeson's singing voice, but his monologue tends to blur together the many vignettes that Mr. Dean tried to cram into this rather simplistic reduction of a major figure. (The play originally ran on Broadway with James Earl Jones.) Robeson deserves better, but this is better than nothing (2:00). Henry Street Settlement's Abrons Arts Center/Recital Hall, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 279-4200.(Anne Midgette) Long-Running Shows 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley) 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley) 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein. (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) * 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 307-4100.(Van Gelder) * 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron District, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) Last Chance 'BEOWULF' Bob Flanagan's luminous puppets of lizards and fish are wonderful, but they are relatively tangential to a so-called rock opera that is not sure whether it wants to be a children's show or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and fails at both. Humans who are less animate than the puppets try to sing their way through an uninspired enactment of this great epic (1:15). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, closing Sunday. ( Midgette) 'MARION BRIDGE' The Canadian playwright Daniel MacIvor takes a quiet, honest look at three sisters as they face their mother's death. It is well acted and well directed, if too predictable in spots (2:20). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, closing Sunday. ( Jefferson) * 'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' This movingly acted revival of Charles Fuller's Pulitzer Prizewinning drama from 1981, directed by Jo Bonney and featuring Taye Diggs, uses the clean-lined conventions of murder mysteries to elicit unsettlingly blurred shades of racism, resentment and self-hatred (1:55). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, closing Sunday.(Brantley) Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. * 'BEE SEASON' (PG-13, 104 minutes) A genuinely felt, finely made adaptation of the Myla Goldberg novel about an 11-year-old girl with an ineffable gift for summoning up perfectly strung-together words. With Richard Gere, Juliette Binoche, Max Minghella and the wonderful newcomer Flora Cross as the family nearly undone by that gift. (Manohla Dargis) 'BLACKMAIL BOY' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Greek) A doctor is sleeping with a younger man, who is having an affair with an older woman, and another character is having sex with her son-in-law. At times, Michalis Reppas and Thanassis Papathanasiou's film has the welcome feeling of farce, but mostly it just seems determined to shock. And to turn violent. (Anita Gates) * 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden) * 'CAPOTE' (R, 114 minutes) Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote is a tour de force of psychological insight. Following the novelist as he works on the magazine assignment that will become ''In Cold Blood,'' the film raises intriguing questions about the ethics of writing. (A. O. Scott) 'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott) 'CLASSE TOUS RISQUES' (No rating, 103 minutes, in French and Italian) Claude Sautet's 1960 gangster melodrama was lost in the shuffle of the new wave; now it is back, in a restored print, with soulful, vivid performances by Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo as a pair of honorable thieves on the run. (Scott) * 'THE DYING GAUL' (R, 105 minutes) Craig Lucas's screen adaptation of his bitter Off Broadway revenge tragedy, is a sublimely acted film and a high point in the careers of its three stars, Campbell Scott, Patricia Clarkson and Peter Sarsgaard, who play a bisexual Hollywood studio executive, his wife and a young screenwriter. (Holden) 'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warm-hearted direction make it watchable. (Scott) * 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is both a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism (Scott) * 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis) 'JARHEAD' (R, 123 minutes) Sam Mendes's film about marines waiting for action in the first gulf war is often vivid and profane, like the Anthony Swofford memoir on which it is based, and some of the performances crackle with energy. But the film as a whole feels strangely detached and -- even more strangely, given its topical resonance -- irrelevant. (Scott) 'KISS KISS, BANG BANG' (R, 103 minutes) Clever and dumb at the same time, this hectic pastiche of Los Angeles. noir conventions offers opportunities for Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan to have a good time with hard-boiled dialogue, and the audience to have a few laughs watching them. The picture's self-conscious manipulations of tone and chronology might have seemed fresh and witty 10 years ago, but probably not even then. (Scott) 'NAKED IN ASHES' (No rating, 108 minutes) This documentary provides an intimate, yet ultimately unsatisfying glimpse into the everyday lives of several Indian yogis, the Hindu mystics who smear their bodies with ash, live in improvised dwellings on the margins of society, and subject their bodies to extreme ascetic. Paula Fouce has gained unprecedented access to her subjects, but her own admiration for them makes this documentary more heartfelt than it is rigorous. (Dana Stevens) * 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden) * 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden) 'PRIVATE' (No rating, 90 minutes, in English, Hebrew and Arabic) This movie distills the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into a nightmarish microcosm when a midnight raid by Israeli soldiers on the house of a peaceful, well-educated Palestinian family turns their home into an occupied territory. (Holden) * 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott) '39 POUNDS OF LOVE' (No rating, 74 minutes, in English and Hebrew) Afflicted by a rare disease that keeps his weight at 39 pounds and allows him to move only one finger, the 34-year-old animator Ami Ankilewitz nevertheless dreams of riding a Harley-Davidson. In his lighthearted yet forthright documentary, ''39 Pounds of Love,'' the director Dani Menkin presents a bracingly honest portrait of a man refusing to be defined by the limitations of his body. (Jeannette Catsoulis) 'UNVEILED' (No rating, 97 minutes, in German and Farsi) Angelina Maccarone's film occasionally suffers from a self-conscious artiness, but at its center is an extraordinary performance by Jasmine Tabatabai as a young woman whose expectations from life have been lowered by a lifetime of systematic mistreatment, but who still holds out hope for the possibility of both justice and love. (Stevens) 'USHPIZIN' (PG-13, 91 minutes, in Hebrew) In this groundbreaking collaboration between secular and Orthodox Israelis, two roustabouts barge into the home of a Hasid and his wife and make comic trouble. (Holden) 'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott) * 'WALLACE & GROMIT: THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT' (G, 85 minutes) The stop-motion pooch and his cheese-loving master, back again at feature length. Silly and sublime. (Scott) 'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden) Film Series FOREVER GARBO: A RETROSPECTIVE (Through Dec. 17) The American-Scandinavian Foundation's program honoring Greta Garbo's centennial continues on Wednesday with ''Mata Hari'' (1931), in which Garbo plays the World War I spy. The film, which also stars Lionel Barrymore and Ramon Navarro, is best known for a famous dance sequence and Adrian's glamorous costumes. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, (212) 879-9779; $8. (Gates) FRAN\u00c7OIS TRUFFAUT (Through Sunday) The IFC Center's Weekend Classics program concludes its Truffaut program this weekend with ''Confidentially Yours,'' the 1983 thriller, today and Sunday, and a marathon of the five Antoine Doinel films tomorrow. Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud stars as Doinel, considered Truffaut's alter ego, in ''The 400 Blows'' (1959), ''Stolen Kisses'' (1968), ''Antoine and Colette'' (a 1962 short), ''Bed and Board'' (1970) and ''Love on the Run'' (1979). 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771; $10.75 ($25 for all five Doinel films). (Gates) HARD QUESTIONS: THE FILMS OF AMOS GITAI. (Through Dec. 8) The Film Society of Lincoln Center's program of work by Mr. Gitai, the Israeli filmmaker, begins on Wednesday with four features. ''Kadosh'' (1999) is about two couples in an ultra-orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood. ''Yom Yom'' (1998) is a dark comedy about a Haifa man who is half-Arab and half-Jewish. ''Kippur'' (2000) is set during the 1973 Yom Kippur War. And Mr. Gitai will introduce his newest film, ''Free Zone'' (2005), a drama starring Natalie Portman and Hanna Laslo.

(Gates) Pop Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music. ASHLEE SIMPSON (Sunday) With her engaging demeanor and rock-star pluck, Ashlee Simpson is, despite her early lip-synching woes, fast leaving her sister Jessica behind in the tabloids. As a vocalist, Ashlee can pout, howl and sass it up, which allows her a dimension beyond the spun sugar of teenage pop. 7 p.m., North Fork Theater, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800; $39.50. (Laura Sinagra) BON JOVI (Monday and Tuesday) Jon Bon Jovi's band conquered the airwaves in the 1980's and 90's by sticking together everything catchy about 70's rock: Bruce Springsteen's earnestness, Led Zeppelin's crunch, Boston's harmonies and lyrics that paint romance as nothing less than a titanic adventure. 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741; $49.50 to $99.50. (Jon Pareles) BRIGHT EYES, FEIST, MAGIC NUMBERS (Tonight and tomorrow) The singer-songwriter Conor Oberst is still perhaps too jittery to resonate as a New Dylan to Old Dylan fans. But his emphatic wisdom, candid political indignance and nuanced wine-soaked laments make him one of the best songwriters of his generation. The warm-voiced Feist is a collaborator of the electroclash queen Peaches and the indie collective Broken Social Scene. Her best songs are quirky, plucked jazz numbers that make her sound like a hipper Norah Jones. London's Magic Numbers, with their diffuse take on 60's harmonies, round out the bill. 8 p.m., Landmark Loews Theater, 54 Journal Square, Jersey City,(866) 468-7619; $25. (Sinagra) MARSHALL CRENSHAW (Sunday) Marshall Crenshaw's songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles -- folk-rock, surf-rock, country and above all, the Beatles -- that put melody first. With his winsome tenor, he delves into the ways love goes right and goes wrong, from distant yearning to the aftermath of infidelity, hiding turmoil within the chiming tunes. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Avenue, East Village, (212) 239-6200; $20. (Pareles) RAY DAVIES (Monday) The Kinks singer Ray Davies performs here in connection with a couple of minireleases, one a benefit five-song EP pegged to Thanksgiving Day, reportedly inspired by recent attempts to better understand the United States. One assumes he will also play classics from his band's catalog and tell some stories, too. 8 p.m., Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-1940; $65. (Sinagra) ROBERTA FLACK (Tomorrow) Behind the gentle, tremulous voice that confided hits like ''The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face'' is long knowledge of the continuum of blues, gospel, soul and jazz. Ms. Flack can use just a touch of rawness to make her songs hit home. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $65. (Pareles) ARLO GUTHRIE (Tomorrow) Forty years after releasing ''Alice's Restaurant,'' this folk-music scion is still revising his songs to tweak the powers that be. He performs his populist story-album, which begins with ''Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago,'' over this holiday weekend. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 501-1390; $38 to $55. (Sinagra) HOT 97 PRESENTS DIP SET (Tonight) Hot 97 D.J.'s Funkmaster Flex and Angie Martinez celebrate the refurbishment of the Bronx's opulent Paradise Theater with a show featuring members of the Harlem rap crew Dip Set: Juelz Santana (''There It Go (The Whistle Song)'' ) and the rappers Jim Jones and Cam'ron. 10 p.m., Paradise Theater, 2403 Grand Concourse, Bronx, ticketmaster.com; $30. (Sinagra) HOT TUNA (Tomorrow) The guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and the bassist Jack Casady started Hot Tuna as a side project from Jefferson Airplane, but it has now long outlasted the original band. Mr. Kaukonen plays spiky, fingerpicked blues that calmly contemplate death and loss, still harking back to the Rev. Gary Davis, with Mr. Casady's bass shadowing him from below. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $38.50 to $48.50. (Pareles) B. B. KING (Sunday through Tuesday) The great bluesman B. B. King and his latest guitar called Lucille can, on a good night, summon all the tribulation and joy and resilience of the blues. 8 p.m., B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $80 in advance (sold out), $85 at the door. (Pareles) KORN (Tuesday) This band helped popularize a brand of late-90's rock that featured chunky chords and angry raps about childhood mistreatment and the adult fallout. Korn's latest video humorously features rappers Lil Jon, Snoop Dog, Xzibit and David Banner pretending to be the band. 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882; $37 in advance, $42 at the door. (Sinagra) THE MENDOZA LINE (Tomorrow) This local band has a knack for deceptively lilting songs with cutting lyrics about betrayal, jealousy and disappointment. Its best choruses turn on phrases like ''It will be the same without you.'' 4 p.m., Sound Fix Records, 110 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-8090; free. (Sinagra) METERS (Tonight) Hurricane Katrina could not drown New Orleans syncopation. It lives on with the reunion of the Meters, the definitive New Orleans funk band since 1967. It has backed others, but saved its snappiest, trickiest grooves for its own tracks. With Art Neville on keyboards, George Porter Jr. on bass, Leo Nocentelli on guitar and Joseph Zigaboo Modeliste on drums, they open up nooks and crannies of the beat to carry every hip into irresistible motion. 8 p.m., Nokia Theater Times Square, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, ticketmaster.com, (212) 307-7171; $50. (Pareles) MIGHTY SPARROW (Sunday) The songwriter and singer who revolutionized calypso after World War II still has sly rhymes and ebullient dance moves, and he is still coming up with up-to-the-minute topical songs. 7 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 531-5305; $35 to $75. (Pareles) AARON NEVILLE (Tomorrow) Aaron Neville of New Orleans's Neville Brothers brings a resolute, pure high vocal quaver to funky R & B, jazz-pop and gospel music, swinging confidently while still conveying heartache. He plays here with a quintet featuring Charles Neville. 8 p.m., Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, www.concertstonight.com, (212) 307-7171; $39.50 to $49.50. (Sinagra) BONNIE RAITT, MARC BROUSSARD (Wednesday and Thursday) Since her days following in the footsteps of blues performers like Sippie Wallace and Son House, Ms. Raitt has been comfortable playing with both rolling funk blues and blues-pop that relies on her clear, wearily emotive voice. Her latest work features stripped down songs about loss and resilience. The rootsy singer Marc Broussard opens. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; $40 to $75. (Sinagra) PATTI SMITH (Wednesday and Thursday) As resolutely pretentious as ever, the punk-poet rocker Patti Smith still has the sinewy swagger to trump young imitators. In celebration of the 30th anniversary of her classic album ''Horses,'' Ms. Smith and her band -- the guitarist Lenny Kaye, the drummer Jay Dee Daugherty, the bassist Tony Shanahan and the guitarist Tom Verlaine, with a special guest, the bassist Flea -- will perform the album in its entirety. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to hurricane-relief organizations. 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $45. (Sinagra) WADADA LEO SMITH AND ALAN KUSHAN (Thursday) The trumpeter and composer Wadada Leo Smith and the santur player and composer Alan Kushan integrate American improvisational music, Persian classical music and Sufi devotional practice in a performance featuring Mr. Smith's Golden Quartet and Mr. Kushan's group, Rumi's Disciple. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 362-8060; $10. (Sinagra) LADY SOVEREIGN (Wednesday) Few M.C.'s ride the jerky rhythms of grime, a British mix of hip-hop and techno, quite like this adorably brash 17-year-old. Her appearance on this year's ''Run the Road'' compilation (Vice) was one of that excellent album's highlights. 9 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15. (Sinagra) BILLY SQUIER (Wednesday) Who knew how important the singer-guitarist behind Zeppelin-lite 80's hits like ''Everybody Wants You'' and ''My Kinda Lover'' would be to hip-hop? B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35.(Sinagra) TOOTS & THE MAYTALS (Sunday) Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Pareles) WE ARE WOLVES (Tomorrow) Among the current wave of Montreal bands, the trio We Are Wolves is less drama clubby than Arcade Fire, fitting more easily into the dance-punk category. 11 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700; $8. (Sinagra) Cabaret Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.

(Stephen Holden) ANNIE ROSS (Tomorrow) Cool, funny, swinging and indestructible, this 75-year-old singer and sometime actress exemplifies old-time hip in its most generous incarnation. 7 p.m., Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133; $25, with a $12 minimum. (Holden) 'SINGING ASTAIRE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) This smart, airy revue, which pays tribute to Fred Astaire, has returned, featuring Eric Comstock, Hilary Kole and Christopher Gines. 5:30 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080; $30, with a $10 minimum. (Holden) STEVE TYRELL (Tonight and tomorrow night, and Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Tyrell has one of those where-have-I-heard-it-before growls that sounds great on a movie soundtrack but loses its charm in a club as he rolls standards off the assembly line as if they were all the same song. 8:45, with additional shows at 10:45 tonight and tomorrow night, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600; $95 tonight and tomorrow; $85 Tuesday and Wednesday; $90 Thursday. (Holden) Jazz Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music. ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET WITH VON FREEMAN (Through Sunday) Mr. Alexander is one of the leading inheritors of a muscular tenor-saxophone style associated with the 1950's; the octogenarian Mr. Freeman, dropping in from his native Chicago, is one of that style's largely unsung but widely influential heroes. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595; cover: $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Nate Chinen) DON BYRON PLAYS JUNIOR WALKER (Thursday) Jazz has many card-carrying eclectics these days, but none more self-assured than Don Byron, who'll favor the tenor saxophone rather than his usual clarinet in this tribute to the R & B hero Junior Walker. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778; cover: $20, with a two-drink minimum.

(Chinen) * BRAD MEHLDAU TRIO (Through Sunday) With ''Day Is Done'' (Nonesuch), the pianist Brad Mehldau has renovated the sound of his longstanding trio, with considerable help from the powerfully expressive drummer Jeff Ballard; the group's luminous brand of lyricism has survived, but its repertory is more pop-inflected and its rhythmic push more pronounced. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037; cover: $20 to $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) CARLI MU\u00d1OZ QUARTET (Wednesday) Mr. Mu\u00f1oz, a pianist active on the 1970's Los Angeles music scene, has kept a low profile since returning to his native Puerto Rico some 20 years ago; as on his new album, ''Maverick'' (Pelosenel Q Lo), he appears here with the bassist Eddie Gomez and the tenor saxophonist David S\u00e1nchez, among others. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover: $20. (Chinen) DAVID (FATHEAD) NEWMAN (Tuesday through Dec. 4) Mr. Newman's tenor saxophone often provided a bluesy counterpoint to the vocals of Ray Charles; in this small-group tribute, vocal duties fall to Cynthia Scott. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set Fridays and Saturdays, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212) 258-9595; cover: $30, with a $10 minimum at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen) JOHNNY O'NEAL TRIO (Tonight and tomorrow) Mr. O'Neal is a pianist born and bred in Detroit and a veteran of more than a few celebrated bands; his trio will be joined, for tonight's two sets, by the imaginative and bluesy trombonist Wycliffe Gordan. 8 10 p.m. and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626; cover: $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) EIVIND OPSVIK'S OVERSEAS (Wednesday) On his recent album ''Overseas II'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), the Norwegian bassist Eivind Opsvik plumbs a strikingly modern (and yes, vaguely Nordic) brand of fusion. 10 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover: $8. (Chinen) ARTURO SANDOVAL (Tuesday through Dec. 4) Mr. Sandoval is a trumpeter best known for stratospheric bravado, although he occasionally reaches for a subtler aesthetic; his Latin-jazz sextet features Ed Calle on saxophone. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592; cover: $30 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen) * MARIA SCHNEIDER ORCHESTRA (Through Sunday) Last year's ''Concert in the Garden'' (ArtistShare) was a success not only for its Internet-only distribution and subsequent Grammy win; the album bespoke this ensemble's rare cohesive precision, along with the sophistication of Ms. Schneider's compositional language. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232; cover: $25 to $30. (Chinen) TODD SICKAFOOSE GROUP (Tuesday) Mr. Sickafoose is a bassist and composer equally fond of rough edges and rounded forms; he showcases his atmospheric compositions in an improvising chamber ensemble that includes Shane Endsley on trumpet, Alan Ferber on trombone, Mike Gamble on guitar and Erik Deutsch on drums. 7 p.m., Barb\u00e8s, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177; cover: $8. (Chinen) * WADADA LEO SMITH AND ALAN KUSHAN (Thursday) Mr. Smith, a trumpeter of high stature in experimental circles, brings the latest edition of his Golden Quartet to this collaboration with the hammered-dulcimer player Alan Kushan; ''Tabligh,'' composed by Mr. Smith and Mr. Kushan, seeks common ground between Sufi devotional music and the jazz avant-garde. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 545-7536; cover: $10, $7 for students. (Chinen) LOREN STILLMAN QUARTET (Wednesday) With his new album, ''It Could Be Anything'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), Mr. Stillman reinforces his reputation as an alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz tradition; he performs here with Jacob Sacks on piano, Scott Lee on bass and Jeff Hirshfield on drums. 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319; cover: $5, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen) TILT BRASS BAND (Wednesday) A raucous assembly of creative horn players -- like the trumpeter Shane Endsley and the trombonist Jacob Garchik -- joined by the pianist Anthony Coleman, who presents the premiere of a piece loosely based on ''Eonta,'' by the classical avant-gardist Iannas Xenakis. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501; cover: $10.

(Chinen) Classical Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music. Opera 'LA BOH\u00c8ME' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) A new cast at the Met has taken the reins of the Puccini favorite: Ruth Ann Swenson is Mim\u00ec, Frank Lopardo is Rodolfo, Emily Pulley is Musetta and Vassily Gerello is Marcello. Philippe Auguin conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Wednesday at 7:30. Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $42 to $320. (Jeremy Eichler) 'CARMEN' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Carmen will sell tickets no matter who is in it. Nancy Fabiola Herrera, who got to open the run at the Metropolitan Opera this season, is singing it tomorrow opposite the tenor Marcello Giordani, who should excel as Don Jos\u00e9; on Tuesday, Denyce Graves is back in one of her signature roles opposite the tenor Eduardo Villa. Ana Maria Martinez, a young soprano with a burgeoning international career, made her company debut as Mica\u00ebla; Erwin Schrott is Escamillo; and Philippe Jordan remains the crisp and able conductor. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Tuesday night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; remaining tickets: $150 to $320 tomorrow, $26 to $320 Tuesday (Anne Midgette). 'ROM\u00c9O ET JULIETTE' (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) The big news from the Metropolitan Opera's new production of Gounod's ''Rom\u00e9o et Juliette,'' is the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay's remarkable portrayal of Juliette. She sings with uncanny agility and lyrical elegance; her light, rich lyric voice shimmers throughout the house; and she affectingly embodies this tragically impulsive young woman. The tenor Ram\u00f3n Vargas, though a stiff actor, delivers a vocally impassioned portrayal of Rom\u00e9o. The Belgian director Guy Joosten's production gives the opera an appropriate Italian Renaissance look, though with surreal touches and some heavy-handed imagery of eternal love amid the starry cosmos. Bertrand de Billy's incisive yet refined conducting of Gounod's most sophisticated score is in every way admirable. At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $320. (Anthony Tommasini) Classical Music ABSOLUTE ENSEMBLE (Thursday) The conductor Kristjan Jarvi and his free-spirited band invariably present innovative programs, played zestily. The group's current offering is an operatic double bill that includes Mozart's youthful ''Zaide'' and Daniel Schnyder's ''Casanova.'' At 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, New York University, 566 La Guardia Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200; $30. (Allan Kozinn) BARGEMUSIC (Tonight through Sunday, and Thursday) Sonatas and Piano Trios by Brahms and Haydn hold the spotlight through the weekend, when Mark Peskanov, the violinist, Peter Bruns, the cellist, and Vladimir Stoupel, the pianist, hold court in this floating concert hall on the East River. On Thursday, Roy Eaton, a pianist, takes over with a program of Bach, Chopin, Gershwin and Joplin. Tonight, tomorrow and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $35, $30 for 65+ (Thursday only), $25 for students. (Kozinn) BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Monday) The big event at this much-anticipated concert is the return of the fantastic mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, who has cancelled much of her schedule this year because of a back injury, singing the first New York performance of ''Neruda Songs'' by her husband, the composer Peter Lieberson. Taking the measure of James Levine's ongoing renaissance in Boston is the other draw, and Mr. Levine will have plenty of chance to show his stuff in ''Till Eulenspiegel'' and the Mahler Fourth. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $33 to $116 (Midgette). BRENTANO STRING QUARTET (Wednesday) This dynamic ensemble opens a new ''salon series'' of free one-hour concerts with Schubert's fiery ''Death and the Maiden'' Quartet. At 7 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 218-7540; free, but reservations are required. (Eichler) SIMONE DINNERSTEIN (Monday) The young American pianist looks back to Bach, in a big way: to be precise, with the Goldberg Variations, a feat of endurance as well as artistry. She's been touring other cities with it and won considerable acclaim, and her unreleased recording is already attracting buzz. Her big, sure, confident playing has been praised in a range of more recent works, from Rochberg to, at this year's Bard Festival, Copland. Check it out. At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15 to $25 (sold out). (Midgette) WOLFGANG HOLZMAIR (Monday and Tuesday) This superb baritone, with Russel Ryan at the piano, performs music by the Austrian composers Eric Zeisl and Franz Mittler. At 8, the Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 319-5300, extension 222; free, but reservations are required. (Kozinn) CHRISTIAN IMMLER (Sunday) This young German baritone makes his New York debut, with Silvia Fraser at the piano, in a program that includes Schumann's ''Dichterliebe'' (Op. 48) and works by Eisler, Ravel, Rankl and Wolf. At 5 p.m., the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700; $20. (Kozinn) ROBERT LEVIN (Thursday) Equally nimble as a pianist and musicologist, Robert Levin hosts another installment of his ''Mozart Explored'' series of concerts with commentary. This time, it's music for wind instruments. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $35 to $40. (Eichler) NEW JERSEY SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Lawrence Foster leads the orchestra in works by Enesco and Mendelssohn (the ''Scottish'' Symphony) as well as Beethoven's Second Piano Concerto with the elegant young pianist Jonathan Biss. At 8 p.m., Richardson Auditorium, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J., (800) 255-3476; $50 to $62. Program repeats tomorrow, Sunday and Tuesday in different locations. (Eichler) THE NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight and tomorrow) Dresden's cathedral, the Frauenkirche, was bombed in the war and only restored after German reunification, and the New York Philharmonic has just played in Dresden as part of the reopening celebrations. For the occasion, the British composer Colin Matthews wrote a new piece, ''Berceuse for Dresden,'' for the Philharmonic and a Dresden-based cellist, Jan Vogler, who makes his subscription debut this weekend with this piece and the Schumann cello concerto. Dvorak's New World Symphony rounds out the concert; Lorin Maazel conducts. At 8 p.m. (a matinee of the Dvorak and Dohnanyi's piano quintet, is tomorrow at 2 p.m.), Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92 ($23 to $64 for the matinee). (Midgette) NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY (Sunday) The concerts by this dynamic orchestra of aspiring young musicians, mostly of high-school age, are never disappointing. The orchestra had a good record of enticing major musicians as soloists, and Sunday afternoon's concert offers Carter Brey, the brilliant principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic, in Dvorak's Cello Concerto. Each concert also presents a premiere by a young composer, and this time it's Ryan Anthony Francis's ''Axiom.'' The conductor Paul Haas ends the program with Beethoven's Fifth. There is nothing like hearing a repertory staple played by thrilled young musicians, many of whom may be playing it for the first time. At 2 p.m., Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $7 to $45. (Tommasini) PIANO TRIOS PLUS (Tomorrow) Prism Projects presents Piano Trios Plus, a concert of new and recent chamber works on Saturday night. Lots of cutting-edge contemporary concerts seem to take place in churches, especially open-minded parishes like St. Peter's in Chelsea, which has long fostered music of all kinds. On this intriguing program, with Robert Frankenberry piano; Roger Zahab, violin; David Russell, cello; and Tanya Maggi, viola, there will be trios by two of my favorite living composers, Lee Hyla and Judith Weir, more trios by David Keberle and Mr. Zahab, with a piano quartet by Ms. Weir to round out the program. At 7:30 p.m., St. Peter's Church in Chelsea, 346 West 20th Street, (212) 741-0011; $10 at the door. (Tommasini) QUEEN'S CHAMBER TRIO (Sunday) Marin Marais was the early music flavor of the month for a while in the late 1980's, after his life was explored in the film ''Tous les Matins du Monde'' (''All the Mornings of the World''). His music still turns up regularly in concerts by Jordi Savall and other gambists, but on Sunday it will be played by this slightly updated ensemble, which uses a cello rather than a gamba. In addition to Marais, the group will perform music by Mozart. At 2 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $30. (Kozinn) EARL WILD (Tuesday) Three days after his 90th birthday, the American pianist Earl Wild will celebrate by giving a substantial recital at Carnegie Hall. Mr. Wild, long acclaimed for his nonchalant brand of virtuosity, has lost a little power and precision in recent years. But this summer at the Mannes College of Music he played a difficult program with fluidity, grace, beautiful colorings and lots of panache. For this occasion he offers works by Beethoven, Liszt, Chopin and himself, as well as his own delightful transcriptions of works by Rachmaninoff and Marcello. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $15 to $90.

Museums AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Over all, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter) ASIA SOCIETY: 'VIETNAM: DESTINATION FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM -- THE ART OF DINH Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson) BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'EDWARD BURTYNSKY: MANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson) * THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter) GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Faberg\u00e9. It immerses us in two enormous, endlessly fascinating narratives: the history of painting and the history of Russia, forming a remarkable tribute to the endurance of the medium and the country, and the inescapable interconnectedness of art and life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Roberta Smith) * JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts that he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. It may not be all that enlightening, but as an artist's personal survey, it comes off. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Grace Glueck) * JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? These are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle-class and of European descent. Using photography and video, the artists have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in rural Postville, Iowa. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Glueck) * METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith) * MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down, the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, s\u00e9ance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Its subjects include the depths of human gullibility and the conjuring power of photography, whose technology, we may forget in the cynical day of digital manipulation and Photoshop, seemed unfathomable to so many people a century and more ago. The exhibition's deeper subject is the dreamer in all of us. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman) * Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well-known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. Frankly, the whole show, even including the bad drawings, is unforgettable. (See above.) (Kimmelman) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: BEYOND THE VISIBLE: 'THE ART OF ODILON REDON,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-si\u00e8cle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter) * MUSEUM OF MODERN ART : 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,' through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman) NEUE GALERIE: 'EGON SCHIELE: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson) * P.S. 1: 'PETER HUJAR,' through Jan. 16. When Peter Hujar died in 1987, he was a figure of acute interest to a small group of fans and unknown to practically everyone else. His photographs of desiccated corpses in Sicilian catacombs and studio portraits of New York's downtown demimonde were a gorgeous shock, and their cocktail of Nadar, Weegee and Vogue shaped the work of many younger artists. This surveyish sampling includes several of his recurrent themes: portraits of people and animals, landscapes, still lifes and erotica. Sensuality and mortality are the binders throughout, inseparable. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084.(Cotter) * P.S. 1: 'THE PAINTED WORLD,' through Jan. 30. Though this 23-artist exhibition of mostly contemporary abstractionists lacks bite as a whole, every individual painter in it is worthy of attention. In addition to ancestral figures like Myron Stout and Moira Dryer, the show includes Philip Taaffe, Mary Heilmann and Chris Martin. (See above.) (Johnson) * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and mid-size New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 864-4500. (Smith) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'OSCAR BLUEMNER: A PASSION FOR COLOR,' through Feb. 12. Not exactly a well-known name today, except to devotees of American Modernism, this German-born architect-turned-painter (1867-1938) was one of the major American artists of the early 20th century. Most of his compositions are unpeopled landscapes depicting houses and building fragments in brilliantly stylized settings in which trees, clouds, smokestacks, telephone poles, water and snow are rendered as rhythmic and dramatic shapes that play off one another almost musically. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Glueck) * WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. (See above) (Kimmelman) Galleries: 57th Street EDWARD MAYER: 'DRAWING OUT' A single work designed for and occupying the entire front exhibition space of this gallery, ''Drawing Out'' looks both sturdy and fragile, a skeletal open-work modular passageway 18-feet-long, put together as if from a giant Erector set. At once disciplined architecture and intuitive sculptural drawing, the piece invites you to enter and explore it, while conveying a disturbing sense of matter out of place. How often do you get to view a drawing from the inside out? Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street (212) 752-1223, through Dec. 3. (Glueck) TOM WESSELMANN: 'WORKS ON PAPER, RETROSPECTIVE' Typed as a Pop artist early on for his portrayals of commercial foodstuffs as well as of stylized women's bodies (or parts thereof) that mingled classic odalisque and sexy pinup, Tom Wesselmann (1931-2004) had other strings to his bow, among them an interest in landscape and, later in his career, large abstract cutouts in metal. His provocative nude icons are here in abundance, but also evident is his interest in Matisse, Picasso and Mondrian. This lively show of 44 works on paper, arranged by his daughter, Kate, also reveals that Wesselmann was a compulsive draftsman, producing and revising many color and compositional studies for his finished works. Maxwell Davidson Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 759-7555, through Dec. 23. (Glueck) * 'THE WOMEN OF GIACOMETTI' A museum-quality show of paintings and sculptures focuses on Alberto Giacometti's curiously asexual representations of his mother, sister, wife and other women in his life. PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 421-3292, through Dec. 17. (Johnson) Galleries: Chelsea POLLY APFELBAUM: 'CARTOON GARDEN' Give Ms. Apfelbaum credit for trying one of her signature fabric floors without color. Still, though the wide rectangular plot of cartoon blossoms drawn with black markers on pieces of white velvet is graphically lively, the aesthetic payoff as a whole is not worth the sacrifice of color. D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 352-9460, through Dec. 23.(Johnson) 'THE ART OF CHESS' Updating a historical show of chess sets by mid-20th-century artists on view at the Noguchi Museum, this entertaining exhibition presents fantastic, funky and elegant chess sets designed by, among others, Damien Hirst, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tom Friedman, Paul McCarthy and Yayoi Kusama -- whose optically ravishing set of dotted gourdlike pieces enclosed within a big, leather-clad pumpkin-shaped container steals the show. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through Dec. 23.(Johnson) * JEREMY BLAKE: 'SODIUM FOX' The best animated video of this innovative artist's career is a dense, briskly based fusion of formalism and underbelly, both indubitably American, propelled by the words and voice of the poet David Berman. Feigen Contemporary, 535 West 20th Street, (212) 929-0500, through Dec. 3. (Smith) * JEREMY COMINS While neither especially original nor current, Mr. Comins's small carved wood sculptures evoke the history of the medium with assured sophistication, impeccable craft and that unmarketable commodity called integrity. Denise Bibro, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 647-7030, through Dec. 10. (Smith) TRACEY EMIN: 'I CAN FEEL YOUR SMILE' This British artist presents embroideredand stitched works about unrequited love that look as if they were made by a distracted teenage girl and also include an internally lighted tower of sticks that alludes to witch burning. Lehmann Maupin, 540 West 26th Street, (212) 255-2923, through Dec. 17. (Johnson) BRIAN FINKE: 'MOST MUSCULAR' Whether bodybuilding is a sport, an art form or a neurosis, the physiques of people who have devoted themselves to growing their muscles are always fascinating to see. Mr. Finke's photographs of scantily clad, extraordinarily pumped-up men and women on stage and behind the scenes at competitions are riveting. ClampArt, 531 West 25th Street, (646) 230-0020, through Dec. 17.(Johnson) MONA HATOUM: 'MOBILE HOME' The playful side of this often politically motivated sculptor prevails. The centerpiece, ''Mobile Home,'' is an arrangement of domestic objects strung on fine cables between metal traffic barriers; it takes a moment to realize that the toys, chairs, suitcases and other items are slowly rolling back and forth on tiny wheels. An installation upstairs consists of a circle of slowly pulsing light bulbs plugged into intricately interwoven cables. Alexander and Bonin, 132 10th Avenue, between 18th and 19th Streets, (212) 367-7474, through Dec. 22. (Johnson) JAMES HAYWARD A veteran Los Angeles-based abstract painter selected for this show by Mike Kelley, Mr. Hayward presents a recent series of single-color paintings made of extremely thick, crisscrossing brush strokes. The optical and tactile combine to exceptionally satisfying effect. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 206-3583, through Dec. 3. (Johnson) GARY KUEHN Since the 1960's, Mr. Kuehn has been inventively exploring material dimensions of sculpture while swerving back and forth between pure abstraction and semiabstract representation. This show features paintings that juxtapose gridded colored dots and skittery black lines made by whipping surfaces with ink-soaked lengths of rope. Esso, 531 West 26th Street, (212) 560-9728, through Dec. 3. (Johnson) MEL LEIPZIG A Trenton-based realist who began exhibiting in the mid-1960's, Mr. Leipzig paints affectionate, exhaustively detailed portraits of people in their homes or workplaces with a deliberately unpolished touch. One subject is a man with a shaved head and a goatee relaxing on his living room sofa in the midst of an amazingly extensive collection of sports memorabilia. Henoch, 555 West 25th Street, (917) 305-0003, through Dec. 3. (Johnson) * ANN LISLEGAARD: 'BELLONA (AFTER SAMUEL R. DELANY)' An entrancing animated video based on a famous science-fiction novel tours a mazelike series of empty rooms. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through Dec. 3. (Johnson) * JULIA OSCHATZ: 'PARALYZED PARADISE III' A talented artist who is rare for being simultaneously German and female paints, dances and hikes (in video) her way through an impressive multimedia debut in a slyly personalized version of Northern Romanticism. Leslie Tonkonow Artworks + Projects, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450, through Dec. 30. (Smith) Other Galleries HANS HOFMANN: 'THE LEGACY' Hofmann was one of the few who made it into the art history hall of fame as both teacher and painter. Along with three works by the master himself, this exhibition presents abstract and semiabstract paintings by disciples who were either directly taught or deeply influenced by him, including Ludwig Sander, Robert De Niro, Louisa Matthiasdottir and Laurie Fendrich. Painting Center, 52 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 343-1060, through Dec. 24. (Johnson) RAY MORTENSON: 'CEDARS/SEA AND SKY' Alternating between the land and sea of Rhode Island, this quietly gripping show of mostly small black-and-white photographs presents soft and misty images of bushy cedars and extraordinarily clear and luminous pictures of ocean waves. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 431-0166, through Dec. 4. (Johnson) * 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AT THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY' Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069, through Feb. 12. (Smith) Last Chance * 'IF IT'S TOO BAD TO BE TRUE, IT COULD BE DISINFORMATION' Old-style political art said yes or no, told you what to do. New-style political art, as often as not, obscures its intentions, makes you wonder what it's up to and goes for confusion, as in this shrewd, dematerialized group exhibition on the subject of disinformation, a passive form of political deceit that tells lies through the omission of facts. The idea is that the less people know about what their government is doing, the less likely they are to raise a fuss. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, closing Saturday. (Cotter) * ANDR\u00c9 KERTESZ From tiny, wonderfully intense pictures made in the teens in Budapest, where Kertesz was born in 1894, to formally acute views of Paris in the 20's and 30's, to emotionally and metaphorically resonant images of New York, where he lived from 1936 to his death in 1985, this beautiful exhibition covers the career of a giant of 20th-century photography. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, closing Sunday. (Johnson) KIM SIMONSSON Under the influence of Japanese manga cartoons, this Finnish ceramicist makes large, monochromatic sculptures of wide-eyed, otherworldly girls and deer. Nancy Margolis, 523 West 25th Street, (212) 242-3013, closing Saturday. (Johnson) 'SYSTEM IN CHAOS: NEW ART BRUT FROM THE CZECH REPUBLIC' Four fascinating Czech outsiders: Zdenek Kosek's small, congested bubble diagrams chart unfathomable verbal associations; Lubos Plny's expansive, finely detailed drawings offer delirious lessons in human anatomy; Zbynek Semerak's small, delicately busy works on paper convey what seems to be a medieval iconography of religion and architecture; and Leos Wertheimer's large drawings portray locomotives with mechanical precision. Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3768, closing Saturday. (Johnson) ROBERT THERRIEN, 'TABLE AND SIX CHAIRS' In a vast corporate atrium stand a table and six chairs that are wholly ordinary-looking except for their gigantic size -- the chair backs rise to almost nine feet, and the top of the table is over six feet. Mr. Therrien transformed his own kitchen furniture into painted metal monuments that make the viewer feel like the protagonist of ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' The Atrium of 590 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, (212) 980-4575, closing Monday.

A1 Vatican Policy Upsets Priests Some priests say they are shocked by a clause in the new Vatican directive that deters most gay men from joining the priesthood.
