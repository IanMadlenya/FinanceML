(CBS) LATE SHOW WITH DAVID LETTERMAN -- First, late-in-life fatherhood; now this. Mr. Letterman's dream comes true as Oprah Winfrey (left), aspiring saint and undisputed queen of daytime television, makes an appearance on his talk show to promote the Broadway musical ''The Color Purple,'' which opens tonight. She's one of the producers, and 20 years ago she made her powerful and decidedly unglamorous acting debut in the film version. 8 P.M. (ABC) HAVE NO FEAR: THE LIFE OF POPE JOHN PAUL II -- Preceding CBS's two-part movie on the same subject by three days, this papal biography stars Thomas Kretschmann (he was a Nazi who loved music in ''The Pianist'') and covers 60 years of John Paul's life. 9 P.M. (NBC) THE APPRENTICE -- The competition is down to four candidates now, and their task is to make a promotional video for Microsoft. One team resorts to sabotage. 9 P.M. (BBC America) SILENT WITNESS -- This is a season premiere but a farewell. Amanda Burton (right) appears in her last episode of this forensics mystery series as Prof. Sam Ryan. After one last case -- the bodies of two young men who appear to have died violently in the 1970's in Northern Ireland -- Sam will be replaced by a bright young archaeopathologist named Nikki (Emilia Fox). 9 P.M. (Bravo) GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS -- Caroling, mall Santas, the Rockefeller Center skating rink, Chrismukkah, a Colorado fruitcake toss and He'Brew beer make the top 100 in this wildly arbitrary listing. How can the original ''Miracle on 34th Street'' be No. 98 and ''National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' No. 85? Part 1 of 4. 9 P.M. (Food) $40 A DAY: NEW YORK CHRISTMAS -- Rachael Ray, as is her wont, goes looking for food bargains (including, in this case, frozen hot chocolate and tandoori chicken) and somehow works nonfood shopping and ice skating into the budget. Clearly she doesn't take taxis. 11 P.M. (Comedy Central) THE DAILY SHOW WITH JON STEWART -- There is just all sorts of excitement on the late-nightschedule. The White Stripes (the retro-rockers Meg and Jack White, above) become the first band ever to perform on Mr. Stewart's comedy-news show.
