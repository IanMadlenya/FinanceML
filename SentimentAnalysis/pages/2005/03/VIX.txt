The Dow rose 135.23 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,540.93. Broader stock indicators also gained ground. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 16.05 points, or 1.38 percent, at 1,181.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 31.79 points, or 1.61 percent, to 2,005.67, after falling to a five-month low on Tuesday. All three major indexes had their biggest one-day point gains since Dec. 1. The Commerce Department said yesterday that fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, less than the 4 percent economists forecast. The department's price index rose 2.9 percent for the quarter, more than Wall Street expected, but was offset by increases in consumer spending and capital expenditures by businesses. ''Normally you wouldn't see this G.D.P. report as a good thing, but with inflation out there, a little bit less growth is viewed as a positive,'' said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at the Boston Company Asset Management. ''It cools things down just enough, without getting too cold.'' The decline in oil prices came after the Energy Department reported an increase of 5.4 million barrels in the nation's crude oil inventory. Crude oil futures were down 24 cents at $53.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Morgan Stanley climbed $1.67, to $55.28, after the company said that three more executives would leave after a management shake-up. Dissident shareholders and former executives have increased calls for the chief executive, Philip J. Purcell, to resign, saying the departure of other executives will not be enough to right the company. Shares of Walt Disney rose 45 cents, to $28.35, a day after the company officially parted ways with the Miramax chiefs, Bob and Harvey Weinstein. Disney will retain the Miramax name and film library, and the Weinstein brothers will take the Dimension Films label and its catalog as the core of a new studio. American International Group lost $1.04, to $57.16, after the company said that it would delay filing its annual report. The company said that it discovered improper documentation for a controversial transaction with a unit of Berkshire Hathaway that is the center of state and federal investigations. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where preliminary consolidated volume came to 2.11 billion shares, compared with 2.22 billion traded on Tuesday. Investors are looking ahead to a pair of economic reports tomorrow: the Labor Department's March employment figures and the Institute for Supply Management's monthly report on the industrial sector. Economic data, particularly employment data, has been closely watched as the Federal Reserve plans its policy on short-term interest rates. The bond market built on Tuesday's strong gains. The 10-year Treasury note rose to 95 21/32 , up 7/32 from Tuesday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, slipped to 4.55 percent, from 4.58 percent on Tuesday.
