In the years that followed, he wrote a handful of original screenplays and added his voice to more than a dozen others, before directing his first feature, ''The Great McGinty,'' released in 1940. Over the next four years, he directed a clutch of peerless, timeless comedies, including ''The Lady Eve,'' ''Sullivan's Travels,'' ''The Palm Beach Story,'' ''The Miracle of Morgan's Creek'' and ''Hail the Conquering Hero'' -- movies as Mad Hatter tea parties in which Dorothy Parker traded quips with Bugs Bunny and Montaigne. By the end of the 1940's, Sturges was a Hollywood washout (more on that later). Even during his greatest success, when the press and the publicists were calling him the town's newest golden boy, Sturges waxed hot and cold at the box office and with the critics, who could not always appreciate his innovations. (His masterpiece, ''Sullivan's Travels,'' confused some with its promiscuous mixture of comedy and drama.) Before the fall, however, it was a creative streak so prodigiously original, so fast and furious, it is hard not to think that movies were made to talk for one reason: to give Sturges a forum for the snaky stories, sophisticated wordplay, razor-sharp zingers, belly-aching guffaws and sexual entanglements he served up as casually as a short stack of flapjacks.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "STURGES, PRESTON"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FILM FORUM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "If the Old Merger Was a Disaster, Why Not Try Another One?", "kicker": "Floyd Norris"}, "snippet": "Happy days are here again for investment bankers.
