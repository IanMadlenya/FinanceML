In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Alzheimer's Association. ELKIN--Milton, M.D. The Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University is deeply saddened by the loss of our Distinguished University Professor Emeritus and Founding Chairman of Radiology. Dr. Elkin came to Einstein in 1954, a year before the medical school officially opened, and created one of the great departments of radiology in the country. His signal contributions to the field were recognized by the American College of Radiology when it presented him with its highest honor, The Gold Medal, in 1977. His inspiring leadership at the medical school and its affiliated hospitals and his commitment to the highest standards for educating generations of caring and compassionate physicians have left an indelible legacy at our medical school. A man of profound integrity and intellect and a valued friend and colleague, his presence in our lives is already sorely missed. We extend our deepest sympathies to Dr. Elkin's son, Dr. Phil Elkin, and daughters, Karen Segall and Laura Friedman, and six grandchildren. Dominick P. Purpura, M.D. The Marilyn and Stanley M.
