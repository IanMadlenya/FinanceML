One highlight was that domestic published coach air fares should rise 5 to 8 percent next year over this year's average. That is partly because airlines, including those in bankruptcy protection, have cut domestic schedules and capacity, said Prashanth Kuchibhotla, the senior manager for air procurement for eClipse Advisers, an American Express subsidiary. Another trend, he said, is that business travelers are seeing some changes in policy as corporate travel departments -- reacting to a simplification in fare structures begun by Delta Air Lines and matched by major rivals early this year -- are allowing more use of unrestricted, fully refundable tickets. MORE BUSINESS JETS -- The business-jet market continues to surge. Shipments of business jets were up 30 percent, to 510 planes, for the first nine months, compared with the period last year, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Total billings through September were $10.4 billion. At the top of the scale, Airbus shipped six A320-family Airbus Corporate Jets ($300 million total) and Boeing shipped three of its 737-family Boeing Business Jets ($133.5 million). HOTEL CHAIN RANKINGS Increasingly, global hotel chains and their various brands dominate the hospitality market. The top five international hotel chains, by number of rooms, according to the latest MKG Consulting survey, are InterContinental, 532,701 rooms, up 49 percent since 1995; Cendant, 520,860 rooms, up 26 percent; Marriott, 469,218 rooms, up 154 percent; Accor, 463,427 rooms, up 81 percent; and Choice, 403,806 rooms, up 37 percent. Hilton, which operates the domestic Hilton Corporation and Hilton International separately, had the biggest overall growth, nearly tripling its number of domestic rooms to 354,312. Hilton International had 99,257 rooms, up 80 percent. AMERICAN ADDS LOUNGE IN DALLAS -- American Airlines opened its fourth Admirals Club lounge at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Saturday. The lounge, in the new international Terminal D, features a business center equipped with personal computers offering free high-speed Internet access. EASY DOES IT -- There was some guffawing among hoteliers when the first easyHotel opened at Earls Court in London in August, offering small rooms (60 to 80 square feet) at cheap rates (about $35 to $79 a night, depending on demand). Well, easyGroup, the holding company of various easy-branded travel services, is the one chuckling now. The London hotel had a 97 percent occupancy rate in August and a 98 percent occupancy rate in September, says easyGroup, the holding company of Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who calls himself a serial entrepreneur. A second easyHotel, in Basel, Switzerland, opened in September and had a 97 percent occupancy rate for the first month, the company says. WISECRACK OF THE WEEK -- The aviation analyst, Michael Boyd, in his weekly discourse at www.aviationplanning.com, on Delta's decision to fold the lime-green planes of its Song unit back into its mainline fleet, with a consequent repainting: ''Other than oil companies, it's paint suppliers that are cleaning up in the airline industry.''
