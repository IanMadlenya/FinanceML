The charge is a familiar one, but it won't stick. Several generations of more or less ''prescriptive'' grammarians, from Johnson to H. W. Fowler to Ernest Gowers to Robert Burchfield, spent most of their careers battling utilized methodologies and their kin. They were also, incidentally, quite merciless toward the shibboleths that Deresiewicz implicitly accuses them of propagating: don't split infinitives, don't end a sentence with a preposition, and so on. (Fowler called the former ''a tyrannous convention'' and the latter ''a cherished superstition.'') As for their less distinguished progeny, the ''grammar police'' -- the schoolmarms and pop grammarians who live by these shibboleths -- yes, they are an ignorant and tiresome lot, but even they do not defend utilized methodologies. In fact, no one does: the conspiracy has no conspirators. Deresiewicz correctly points out that many notions about grammar and usage are motivated by snobbery and class. But that proves nothing: so is the suggestion to keep one's feet off the dinner table, which nevertheless remains pretty good advice. In the Yale dining halls, they still follow it. I applaud Deresiewicz's call for ''Correct English without the attitude.'' Speaking of attitude, let's resolve not to attack straw men, and not to dismiss sound principles just because they spring from motives that we regard as impure.
