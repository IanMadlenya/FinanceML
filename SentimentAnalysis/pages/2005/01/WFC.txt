Disney's chief financial officer, Thomas O. Staggs, predicted double-digit earnings growth for the next year. Mr. Staggs spoke from a ballroom at the Walt Disney Resort, where analysts and investors were gathered for their yearly conference. Net income for the first quarter of 2005 was up 5 percent, to $723 million, from $688 million in the period a year earlier. Diluted per-share earnings were 35 cents, higher than analysts' expectations. Thomson First Call had predicted a consensus of 29 cents a share. Revenue was relatively flat, increasing 1 percent, to $8.66 billion. The results were welcome for Disney and its investors. The company has shown signs of a rebound after years of foundering. The ABC network has had solid hits in ''Desperate Housewives'' and ''Lost,'' visitors are starting to return to theme parks, and ESPN, one of Disney's most valuable properties, continues to report higher affiliate revenues. The results are also expected to reflect positively on the president of Disney, Robert A. Iger, who hopes to succeed the chief executive, Michael D. Eisner. Mr. Eisner said last year that he would not seek to renew his contract after September 2006. In contrast to most of the company's earnings presentations, at this one, Mr. Eisner and Mr. Iger were absent, attending meetings with directors and senior executives, and did not address the analysts. Many questions about Disney's businesses were left unanswered as Mr. Staggs told the crowd it would learn more at division presentations on Tuesday. This year's analyst conference was subdued, in contrast to last year's meeting, when the Comcast Corporation, the largest cable operator in the United States, made an unsolicited $54.1 billion takeover offer for Disney. At last year's meeting, Disney's strong earnings were overshadowed by questions about its future and what role Mr. Eisner would play in it. In the most recent quarter, ended Dec. 31, operating income in the media networks division, which comprises properties like ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel, was up 36 percent over the period a year earlier, to $467 million. The cable networks soared 67 percent. ''You all have seen what hits do for a network and how the margins can swing dramatically,'' Mr. Staggs said, referring to the ABC network. Parks and resorts, for their part, were up 11 percent in operating income to $258 million, from $232 million a year earlier. Results for studio entertainment were damped compared with the quarter last year, when blockbusters like ''Finding Nemo,'' ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' and the platinum release of the Disney classic ''The Lion King'' buoyed the division to operating income of $458 million. On Monday, Disney announced operating income of $333 million for the same time period, largely because of lower DVD sales. Disney has yet to announce its separation from Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the co-founders of Miramax Films, who are expected to leave Disney and begin their own filmmaking venture. People involved in those talks say an announcement could be made in the next two weeks. Mr. Staggs said Disney was going to expand into video games, investing less than $50 million as it explores the business.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "STAGGS, THOMAS O"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DISNEY, WALT, CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPANY REPORTS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Sweating Depression Away", "kicker": "VITAL SIGNS: MENTAL HEALTH"}, "snippet": "People with mild to moderate depression can significantly reduce their symptoms if they exercise aerobically, a new study reports.", "abstract": "Cooper Institute researcher Dr Andrea L Dunn leads study that shows aerobic activity can significantly reduce symptoms of mild to moderate depression in adults; study is published in American Journal of Preventive Medicine (S)", "lead_paragraph": "People with mild to moderate depression can significantly reduce their symptoms if they exercise aerobically, a new study reports.
