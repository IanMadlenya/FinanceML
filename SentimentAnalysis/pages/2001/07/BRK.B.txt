And while only a few turned out at the only polling place on the only day when votes could be cast in person, Prudential executives suggested that they were not worried about getting the required minimum of a million votes -- two-thirds of them in favor -- for authorization of the reorganization. Mary Flowers, a spokeswoman for Prudential, said Prudential would not say how many people had voted until an official tally was completed in several days. The approval of New Jersey's banking and insurance commissioner would also be required for the reorganization. If the reorganization takes place, as Prudential executives hope, the policy holders will share $20 billion in accumulated profits.
