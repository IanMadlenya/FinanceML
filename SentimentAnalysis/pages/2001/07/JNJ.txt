But when the ball was fired out of the pocket, crisp and bullet-like, it was clear his arm was as strong as any quarterback's in football despite his short stature. When Flutie then threw a deep sideline out pass -- one of the hardest passes to complete -- the ball zipped through the outstretched arms of two defenders and hit the target hard in the chest. Chargers players have seen Flutie's arm strength before, but some are still amazed that it is packed into such a small package. After one sideline pass, some of Flutie's teammates shouted: ''Fluuuuutieeee!''", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "FLUTIE, DOUG"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SAN DIEGO CHARGERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOTBALL"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "HOUSE BACKS BAN ON HUMAN CLONING FOR ANY OBJECTIVE"}, "snippet": "After an impassioned debate that pitted the promise of cures for disease against the horror of making babies that are genetic replicas of adults, the House of Representatives voted by a wide margin today to ban cloning, not only for reproduction but...", "abstract": "House, 265-162, approves Rep Dave Weldon's far-reaching bill to ban human cloning for reproduction or medical research; bill would also ban sale of treatments developed from cloning; Pres Bush lauds vote; House earlier rejected Rep James Greenwood's less restrictive bill, which would have barred making babies by cloning while leaving door open for creating embryos to be used to treat disease (M)", "lead_paragraph": "After an impassioned debate that pitted the promise of cures for disease against the horror of making babies that are genetic replicas of adults, the House of Representatives voted by a wide margin today to ban cloning, not only for reproduction but also for medical research.

It contains some useful suggestions to improve electricity transmission and streamline the distribution of natural gas. It also has modest subsidies for alternative fuels like wind and solar power and modest tax credits for energy-efficient cars and homes. On the whole, however, it is a dismal compendium of tired ideas favoring the coal, oil and gas industries.
