Microsoft and its lawyers were undoubtedly pleased that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit focused as intently in this week's oral argument on the behavior of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson as on the company's own misconduct. But the software giant should not get too confident. The more than seven hours of testimony did little to undermine the soundness of Judge Jackson's central finding that Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust laws. The very strength of the government's case is what makes Judge Jackson's behavior especially lamentable. In particular, the judge's ill-advised public statements about the case -- for example, comparing Microsoft to a drug gang -- violate judicial norms and create the unfortunate impression that he may have been biased.

Edwards, the Circuit Court's chief judge, rightly said: ''The system would be a sham if all judges went around doing this.''", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "JACKSON, THOMAS PENFIELD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "JUSTICE DEPARTMENT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MICROSOFT CORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STATES (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER SOFTWARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND LAWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  KELLER, FREDERICK A."}, "snippet": "KELLER-Frederick A.

While Wall Street frets over whether the discovery that the genome consists of ''only around 30,000 genes'' will limit the market value of genomics companies, the potential impact of genomics on the economy and society runs much deeper. Most fundamentally, cloning and genetic engineering could change the distribution of characteristics in the population. By most accounts, the remaining technical hurdles are about to be cleared to make human cloning feasible. Cloning is a prerequisite for genetic engineering, the process of altering or adding genes to an embryo. If the experience of earlier reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization is a guide, the marketplace -- not government regulation or prevailing ethical norms -- will determine who avails themselves of cloning services.
