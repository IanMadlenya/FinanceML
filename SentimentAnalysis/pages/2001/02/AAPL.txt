In January, an international team of doctors announced plans to clone a human within 18 months. In February, two teams of researchers published a map of the human genome. While Wall Street frets over whether the discovery that the genome consists of ''only around 30,000 genes'' will limit the market value of genomics companies, the potential impact of genomics on the economy and society runs much deeper. Most fundamentally, cloning and genetic engineering could change the distribution of characteristics in the population. By most accounts, the remaining technical hurdles are about to be cleared to make human cloning feasible. Cloning is a prerequisite for genetic engineering, the process of altering or adding genes to an embryo. If the experience of earlier reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization is a guide, the marketplace -- not government regulation or prevailing ethical norms -- will determine who avails themselves of cloning services.
