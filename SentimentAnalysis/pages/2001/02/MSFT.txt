Microsoft and its lawyers were undoubtedly pleased that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit focused as intently in this week's oral argument on the behavior of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson as on the company's own misconduct. But the software giant should not get too confident. The more than seven hours of testimony did little to undermine the soundness of Judge Jackson's central finding that Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust laws. The very strength of the government's case is what makes Judge Jackson's behavior especially lamentable. In particular, the judge's ill-advised public statements about the case -- for example, comparing Microsoft to a drug gang -- violate judicial norms and create the unfortunate impression that he may have been biased. As Harry T. Edwards, the Circuit Court's chief judge, rightly said: ''The system would be a sham if all judges went around doing this.''", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "JACKSON, THOMAS PENFIELD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "JUSTICE DEPARTMENT"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MICROSOFT CORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STATES (US)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER SOFTWARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ANTITRUST ACTIONS AND LAWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Is the Pen as Mighty As the Keyboard?", "kicker": "NEWS WATCH"}, "snippet": "Thanks to the popularity of the Palm and its many imitators, the pen has joined the mouse and the keyboard as an inputting tool, at least for hand-held computers.
