That film's unsentimental explicitness shocked audiences in both the United States and France when it was released two years ago. Crude, unpolished, yet curiously dreamy, ''A Real Young Girl,'' coming after ''Romance,'' looks and sounds like the product of an era at once angrier and more innocent than our own. Which it is: the film was completed in 1976 and never released, apparently because it was too raw for the mainstream and too strange for the pornography market. But the times, for better or for worse, have fashioned a niche for Alice (Charlotte Alexandra), the sullen, curious teenager whose body and soul are laid bare by Ms. Breillat's camera.

The museum has one of the oldest and most important collections of African art in the country. Just a few years ago, 250 objects from the permanent collection were installed in revamped first-floor galleries; now two dozen pieces have been added and the space has been redesigned again, this time with multicolored walls, mural-size color photographs, documentary films and ambient sound. Added works expand the definition of African to include both Morocco and ancient Nubia. And the overall selection, from familiar friends to treasures recently acquired, is thrilling. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month).
