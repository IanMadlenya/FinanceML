The ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 10. Now Playing ''ANGEL EYES,'' starring Jennifer Lopez and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Luis Mandoki (R, 100 minutes). Ms. Lopez is a tough Chicago police officer and Mr. Caviezel the quiveringly sensitive amnesiac survivor of a car accident in which she saved his life. (Or did she?) After he saves hers, they become lovers. A thoroughly synthetic concoction (with nifty action sequences) that stirs together elements of ''The Sixth Sense,'' ''Frequency'' and ''City of Angels,'' the movie tosses in an earnest subplot about battered wives. Imagine Jane Russell and Montgomery Clift in a clinch, and you'll have some idea of the absence of romantic chemistry between the two stars (Stephen Holden).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Shares Up Slightly in Rebound From Technology Sell-Off", "kicker": "THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS"}, "snippet": "Stock prices rose modestly yesterday as investors, fresh from a sharp sell-off of technology stocks on Wednesday, spent the day hunting for bargains.
