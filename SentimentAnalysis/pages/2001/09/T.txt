Distilling those five lives into two hours, Ms. Finitzo has delivered a remarkable testament to the resiliency of youth.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FIVE GIRLS (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "POV (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Money Will Go Out, He Says, but First It Must Come In", "kicker": "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PITCH"}, "snippet": "Who says the age of irony is over?
