The director, Maria Finitzo, spent three years following her subjects, each of whom manages to discuss her life with a simple eloquence. Distilling those five lives into two hours, Ms. Finitzo has delivered a remarkable testament to the resiliency of youth.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FIVE GIRLS (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "POV (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Ashcroft, Seeking Broad Powers, Says Congress Must Act Quickly", "kicker": "A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LAWMAKERS"}, "snippet": "Attorney General John Ashcroft implored lawmakers today to approve the Bush administration's antiterrorism package by next week, warning: ''Talk will not prevent terrorism.
