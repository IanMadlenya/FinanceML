The Isley Brothers have been dispensing make-out music since 1959, from the early days of soul music to the hip-hop era. They have stayed up to date by latching quickly onto rhythm-and-blues innovations from the secularized gospel of ''Shout'' in 1959 to the funk of ''It's Your Thing'' to the chunky new-jack rhythms of their most recent songs. On albums they have sung social commentary alongside come-ons, but their specialty since the 1970's has been unhurried boudoir grooves, which have gone on to influence rhythm-and-blues Romeos like R. Kelly and Usher.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "ISLEY BROTHERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Miami Has Weaknesses, But Try to Find Them", "kicker": "COLLEGES"}, "snippet": "Perhaps it is not such a big deal that Bryant McKinnie, Miami's best offensive lineman, underwent arthroscopic knee surgery less than a month ago.
