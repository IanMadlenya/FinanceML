The Isley Brothers have been dispensing make-out music since 1959, from the early days of soul music to the hip-hop era. They have stayed up to date by latching quickly onto rhythm-and-blues innovations from the secularized gospel of ''Shout'' in 1959 to the funk of ''It's Your Thing'' to the chunky new-jack rhythms of their most recent songs. On albums they have sung social commentary alongside come-ons, but their specialty since the 1970's has been unhurried boudoir grooves, which have gone on to influence rhythm-and-blues Romeos like R.
