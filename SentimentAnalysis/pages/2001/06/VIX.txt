Written and directed by and starring Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason Leigh (R, 115 minutes). The ensemble performances in this chilly study of a Hollywood party celebrating the sixth wedding anniversary of an insecure star (Ms. Leigh) and a British novelist (Mr. Cumming) are of a quality rarely seen in a Hollywood film. An occasion that is also the official reunion of this mismatched couple begins to unwind after a party guest passes around Ecstasy, and everyone's suppressed emotions burst to the surface. It's not Chekhov by a long shot, but it's several cuts above your average television soap opera.
