But who can bear to look away during a sex scene? Regardless of how we might judge it later, it's hard to take our eyes off that car wreck of human flesh. Nevertheless, audiences have always been ambivalent about what they do and do not want to see on the screen -- even when a sex scene was but a first kiss and a racy cut to the cigarette. We might think we like our movies hot, but in reality a sex scene is more often something to be endured, an uncomfortable moment before the audience breathes again. Mysterious as desire itself, what one person finds sexy is vulgar to another.

His first heirs generally took a passive approach to the property, content to collect rent.
