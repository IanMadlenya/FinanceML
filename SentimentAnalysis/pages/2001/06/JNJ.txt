What did he have to gain? And whom, exactly, did he hurt? Such behavior is hardly unique. American history is littered with public figures -- Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Senator Joe McCarthy come quickly to mind -- who embellished their war records and took whopping liberties with their past.

Contributions to the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. EISENSTEIN-Ira, Rabbi. Our teacher, our mentor, our colleague, our friend. We are grateful for his long life and grieved at his passing. From Ira Eisenstein we learned that unity in diversity is not merely a slogan, but an ethical committment; that a soft word is more effective than a harsh one; that our thinking, whatever directions it may take, must be clear, consistent and reasonable; and most importantly that Klal Yisrael, the entire Jewish people, is both our source of nourishment and our constituency. His determination to make Reconstructionist Judaism into a movement, and to establish the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, made it possible for us to become rabbis; wherever we reach and teach people in the spirit of open inquiry and intellectual honesty, his legacy endures. Our deepest condolences to his family who so lovingly shared him with us. With love and respect, from his students, the colleagues of the Reconstructionist Rabinical Association. EISENSTEIN-Ira. Founder of the Reconstructionist movement and the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, he was a rabbi, a scholar and a mensch who embodied in his daily actions everything that he believed in, and dedicated his life to making his dreams for the Jewish people a reality. He believed the godly was made manifest in how we treat each other and he lived by that philosophy himself. We will long remember his visionary courage. His undaunted spirit and great heart will be missed by his students, faculty and Board of Governors of the College. May his memory be a blessing to his children and grandson. Aaron Ziegelman Donald L. Shapiro David A. Teutsch EISENSTEIN-Rabbi Ira. The Board, Staff and affiliated communities of the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation, express profound sorrow at the passing of our mentor, movement-builder and friend. His vision and leadership were instrumental in creating and nurturing our movement. We express heartfelt condolences to his daughters, Miriam and Anne. May his memory be a blessing. Richard Haimowitz, President Mark Seal, Exec. V.P. EISENSTEIN-Ira. Devoted Rabbi, Editor and Educator.
