So Shakespeare starts his Sonnet XVI. The distributors of ''O'' sought to defeat Time by simply waiting for a media storm to dissipate. Not much of a stratagem, since ''O,'' the director Tim Blake Nelson's updating of ''Othello'' set in an American prep school, was made so long ago than Mekhi Phifer could still get away with playing a teenager -- well, almost. Filming was completed in 1999, the same year as the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, and the picture made Miramax, the distributing company, nervous because it feared the gun violence in ''O'' might incite copycat gunplay. Lions Gate is finally bringing the film to theaters. Mr. Phifer has the title role in Brad Kaaya's adaptation. In trying to make ''Othello'' more lifelike and bring it down to a younger audience -- in effect, to make it more democratic -- the adaptation has rendered the material artless. And ''O'' has been beaten to the punch by so many other movies that the picture feels utterly superfluous.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "O (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "OTHELLO (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SHAKESPEARE, WILLIAM"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "NELSON, TIM BLAKE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PHIFER, MEKHI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KAAYA, BRAD"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Gimelstob Says Fine For Spitting Is Low", "kicker": "TENNIS: NOTEBOOK"}, "snippet": "Michal Tabara spewed his frustration in the direction of Justin Gimelstob Wednesday and will now pay for his spitting.

The museum has one of the oldest and most important collections of African art in the country. Just a few years ago, 250 objects from the permanent collection were installed in revamped first-floor galleries; now two dozen pieces have been added and the space has been redesigned again, this time with multicolored walls, mural-size color photographs, documentary films and ambient sound. Added works expand the definition of African to include both Moroccan and ancient Nubian. And the overall selection, from familiar friends to treasures recently acquired, is thrilling.
