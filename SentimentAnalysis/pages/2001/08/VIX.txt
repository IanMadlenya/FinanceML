So Shakespeare starts his Sonnet XVI. The distributors of ''O'' sought to defeat Time by simply waiting for a media storm to dissipate. Not much of a stratagem, since ''O,'' the director Tim Blake Nelson's updating of ''Othello'' set in an American prep school, was made so long ago than Mekhi Phifer could still get away with playing a teenager -- well, almost. Filming was completed in 1999, the same year as the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado, and the picture made Miramax, the distributing company, nervous because it feared the gun violence in ''O'' might incite copycat gunplay. Lions Gate is finally bringing the film to theaters. Mr. Phifer has the title role in Brad Kaaya's adaptation. In trying to make ''Othello'' more lifelike and bring it down to a younger audience -- in effect, to make it more democratic -- the adaptation has rendered the material artless.

Now Playing ''AMERICAN PIE 2,'' starring Jason Biggs, Eugene Levy, Shannon Elizabeth and Alyson Hannigan. Directed by J. B. Rogers (R, 104 minutes). This sequel reunites the Michigan teenagers whose clumsy eagerness to be relieved of their virginity fueled the first picture. A lot of the humor in this film consists of references to stuff that happened the first time around, though Mr. Biggs does encounter some novel forms of sexual humiliation, including the painful misapplication of some super-adhesive glue. The rest of the cast members return, some of them quite briefly, for more of the dirty-minded, curiously sweet-natured scenes that are the secret of the franchise's success (A. O.
