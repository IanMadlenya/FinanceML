Most people who do not ponder the conundrums of existence for a living have been in Dr. Johnson's corner, rather blithely assuming that reality simply is, that stones are hard and water wet and that it isn't just our imaginations that tell us so. The advent of photography shone an intense light on reality and its relationship to representation, for many people faced with a photograph rather confused the two. Later in the 19th century, some writers and critics said that too much reality would be the ruin of art. The artist-protagonist of Henry James's ''Real Thing'' had ''an innate preference for the represented subject over the real one: the defect of the real one was so apt to be a lack of representation.''
