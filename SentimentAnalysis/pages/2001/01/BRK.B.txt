Now it may be a bit of a puzzlement: do we really need new translations of these canonical works? Well, why do we need another recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony? There are endless recordings of the classics, and to people who have the occasion to buy one for a gift the choices are sometimes bewildering. The same can be said for classical literature. Is there an academic or a commercial need for new translations? It would seem that each generation views and interprets classical works in the light of its own experience -- a justification for updating them -- except perhaps for Shakespeare, who confronts us all the time in movies and the theater and who is very much alive and with us.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BEOWULF (EPIC POEM)"}, {"name": "creative_works", "value": "INFERNO (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DANTE ALIGHIERI"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POETRY AND POETS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRANSLATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "A Storm Brewing, in the Middle-Aged Soul and at Sea", "kicker": "THEATER REVIEW"}, "snippet": "In ''Barking Sharks,'' the playwright Israel Horovitz offers stark proof of how quickly time can wreak its cruel damage.
