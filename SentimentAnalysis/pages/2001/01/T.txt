Wandering the same streets of the same burning city killing the same flesh-eating zombies, it is difficult to distinguish Nemesis from the predecessors Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code Veronica. And while I never played the original Resident Evil, I suspect that it would not seem unfamiliar. Capcom is probably loath to fiddle too much with a formula that has been so successful. Resident Evil's mixture of puzzles and carnage has been codified as the survival-horror genre and mimicked in games like Dino Crisis II and the annoying Evil Dead: Hail to the King, by THQ. These Resident Evil clones can supply the variety lacking in the original. The best example of that is Squaresoft's Parasite Eve II, a game that shamelessly copies the look and sensibility of Resident Evil while managing to create a quite distinct experience.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "SQUARESOFT INC"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CAPCOM ENTERTAINMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER AND VIDEO GAMES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Remembering Rough Rider Who Was a President", "kicker": "SCREEN GRAB"}, "snippet": "WHEN William McKinley died from an assassin's bullet on Sept. 14, 1901, ''that damned cowboy,'' in the words of the industrialist Mark Hanna, became the 26th president.

Both very different from ''Silas Marner,'' for instance, which was the literary castor oil that generations of high school students were also forced to choke down. Now it may be a bit of a puzzlement: do we really need new translations of these canonical works? Well, why do we need another recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony? There are endless recordings of the classics, and to people who have the occasion to buy one for a gift the choices are sometimes bewildering. The same can be said for classical literature. Is there an academic or a commercial need for new translations?
