Calling Billy ''direct'' would be a great understatement. He was a sharp observer of the human condition and never hesitated to share his views with those who would listen. Billy was also a great friend. Whether he was trying to help a friend in need, or teach something to a friend he thought needed teaching, Billy undertook the task with clarity and enthusiasm. Billy was also very proud of Jason and Eleanor and never missed an opportunity to recount the latest developments in their lives. We've lost one from the old school. I'll miss you pal. Carl F. Schwartz BARRETT-William L. While Bill always reminded his listeners that he was a product of Jesuit schooling, he grew into being the Rabbi to many giants in the real estate industry who considered Bill a true friend, advisor and mentor, not just for the immediate but of lifelong duration. He was charitable to many causes, attending few functions in person, but always by contributions and sharing. He never said no.
