A fierce competitor of Sony and Microsoft in the booming game console business, Nintendo said it had sold 510,000 GameCube machines, which would set a record for the biggest console introduction in the United States. The company has shipped 740,000 of the systems, which sell for $200, about two-thirds the price of Sony's PlayStation2 and Microsoft's Xbox. Nintendo has begun pumping 125,000 more machines a week into the market to keep up with demand. But the biggest surprise, analysts said, was the sharp increase in sales of Nintendo's less expensive hand-held game systems during Thanksgiving week. The GameBoy Advance sold 310,000 units, compared with 145,000 the previous week. Sales of GameBoy Color jumped to 504,000 from 35,000, spurred largely by steep price cuts at two retail chains.
