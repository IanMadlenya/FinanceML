Many included alternative name suggestions; about which, more in a moment.This week, we'd like more than comments. Following the terrific response to our 2007 exercise in taxi logo redesign, we hope the designers among you -- amateur and pro -- will consider drawing up a hypothetical logo proposal for the new building. Image files in JPG or GIF formats are preferable, sent as e-mail attachments to cityroom@nytimes.com by 5 p.m. Friday. You're free to use whatever building name suits you, but please relate the appearance of the logo to the words. (We've prepared a few examples, to the left and below, of what we're talking about.) The best logos will be displayed on City Room next week. There is no reward other than the satisfaction of seeing your work on the site.
