She was born in Vienna in 1914. After a brief but successful career in the theater working with Max Reinhardt, she came to America in 1940 and found a job as secretary and research assistant in the offices of Architectural Forum, a part of Time Inc. After the Managing Editor expressed unhappiness with her office layout, Maria suggested that it was \"...because the designers have not paid attention to how you work.\" When challenged to propose something better, she redesigned that office, and then subsequently the offices of Time Inc. itself, and the firm of Maria Bergson Associates (MBA) was born. MBA revolutionized commercial office design. The old roll-top desk was replaced by interchangeable components forming work surfaces resting on different file cabinets, and her many innovations were publicized by Fortune Magazine in 1946. The firm's reputation continued to grow over a long period of time, and its business flourished with offices in New York, Los Angeles and London. In time she did work for many banks, but also for major companies in virtually all well-known industries. She even designed the Admiral's suite and the crew quarters of the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the Independence. Maria Bergson's family, who had all also left Vienna, were extremely important to her, and throughout her life she went to extraordinary lengths helping generations of her relatives. She is survived by her husband of 67 years, Thomas L. Brunner, and various nephews, grandnephews and grandnieces. There will be a service at 3:00pm on Friday April 3rd, at Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Chapel on Madison Avenue at 81st Street.<br><br>", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"seo": "A Compendium of Chocolate Wisdom", "main": "A Compendium of Chocolate Wisdom", "print_headline": "A Compendium of Chocolate Wisdom", "content_kicker": "Food Stuff"}, "snippet": "\u201cChocolate: History, Culture and Heritage\u201d is a scholarly tome, but it offers plenty of surprises, too.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "\u201cChocolate: History, Culture and Heritage\u201d is a scholarly tome, but it offers plenty of surprises, too.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "value": "Chocolate", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "value": "Books and Literature", "name": "subject"}]}, {"headline": {"seo": "A Little Humor?
