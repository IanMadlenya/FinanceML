The problem: How do you market the tallest skyscraper at the World Trade Center site to prospective tenants? When readers were reminded last week that the authority had -- largely for leasing reasons -- quietly been replacing the symbolic name \"Freedom Tower\" with the more prosaic (but also symbolic) \"1 World Trade Center,\" hundreds of comments followed. Many included alternative name suggestions; about which, more in a moment.This week, we'd like more than comments. Following the terrific response to our 2007 exercise in taxi logo redesign, we hope the designers among you -- amateur and pro -- will consider drawing up a hypothetical logo proposal for the new building. Image files in JPG or GIF formats are preferable, sent as e-mail attachments to cityroom@nytimes.com by 5 p.m. Friday. You're free to use whatever building name suits you, but please relate the appearance of the logo to the words. (We've prepared a few examples, to the left and below, of what we're talking about.) The best logos will be displayed on City Room next week. There is no reward other than the satisfaction of seeing your work on the site.

She was born in Vienna in 1914. After a brief but successful career in the theater working with Max Reinhardt, she came to America in 1940 and found a job as secretary and research assistant in the offices of Architectural Forum, a part of Time Inc. After the Managing Editor expressed unhappiness with her office layout, Maria suggested that it was \"...because the designers have not paid attention to how you work.\" When challenged to propose something better, she redesigned that office, and then subsequently the offices of Time Inc. itself, and the firm of Maria Bergson Associates (MBA) was born. MBA revolutionized commercial office design. The old roll-top desk was replaced by interchangeable components forming work surfaces resting on different file cabinets, and her many innovations were publicized by Fortune Magazine in 1946. The firm's reputation continued to grow over a long period of time, and its business flourished with offices in New York, Los Angeles and London. In time she did work for many banks, but also for major companies in virtually all well-known industries. She even designed the Admiral's suite and the crew quarters of the first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, the Independence. Maria Bergson's family, who had all also left Vienna, were extremely important to her, and throughout her life she went to extraordinary lengths helping generations of her relatives. She is survived by her husband of 67 years, Thomas L. Brunner, and various nephews, grandnephews and grandnieces. There will be a service at 3:00pm on Friday April 3rd, at Frank E. Campbell's Funeral Chapel on Madison Avenue at 81st Street.<br><br>", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"seo": "A Little Humor?
