Maloney, 71, passed away on September 25th on Cho Oyu Mountain located between the boarder of Nepal and China. He had reached the 27,000 ft summit on the morning of September 24th, making him the oldest American to ever summit an 8,000 meter peak. He spent that night at Base Camp 3 and arrived the following day at Base Camp 2 at 23,000 feet where he died in his sleep. His last words were, \"I'm the happiest man in the world. I've just summited a beautiful mountain.\" Born in Philadelphia on October 15, 1937, Mr. Maloney graduated from Princeton University in 1960, Harvard Business School in 1965, and served in the U.S. Navy from 1960-1963. An investment banker and real estate investor, Mr. Maloney worked at several financial services companies, including The City Management Corp, Electronic Bond and Share Company, and New York Securities Co., Inc. In 1974, he became a Vice President of Goldman, Sachs & Co. In 1981, he founded his own company, C.H.W. Maloney & Co., Incorporated, to acquire established businesses for long term investment. Mr. Maloney served as a director of several companies, including The Wall Street Fund, Inc. and Interpool Limited. Mr. Maloney was a dedicated marathon runner who had finished the New York Marathon 20 times and in 2008 finished as the fastest American in his age group. He enjoyed sailing and was a member of the New York Yacht Club. Deeply committed to the quality of life in his local community, Mr. Maloney was on the Board of Civitas and the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens and was active in Carnegie Hill Neighbors. He was the Annual Giving Class Agent for the Princeton Class of 1960 and was proud to report more than 70% class participation. He was an avid mountain climber having climbed five of the Seven Summits (including Mount Elbrus, Aconcagua, Mount Vinson, Denali, and Mount Kilimanjaro). In addition, he climbed Orizaba, Mexico's highest volcano. He was a member of the Explorer's Club and the American Alpine Club. His passion for mountain climbing and an equally great passion for boats of all sorts stemmed from his experiences as a lifelong summer resident of Blue Mt. Lake in the Adirondacks. Mr. Maloney is survived by his wife, Congresswoman Carolyn Jane Bosher Maloney to whom he was married in 1976, his daughters, Christina Paul Maloney and Virginia Marshall Maloney, his mother, Virginia Wells Maloney, his sister, Virginia Maloney Lawrence, and eight nieces and nephews. In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the Clifton H.W. Maloney Scholarship Fund at Princeton University, the Explorer's Club or the American Alpine Club.
