For Oregon, the Rose Bowl can serve as another high note in a year to remember. Before we forget, these Ducks experienced what looked to be a monumental defeat in the season opener against Bose State; I can admit I thought Oregon would not recover from that 19-8 loss. Recover it did, and its enters this game with a very good chance at winning the program's first Rose Bowl since 1917.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Week 17 N.F.L.
