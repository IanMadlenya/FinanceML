On one hand, you have the Big East champion Bearcats, who sport one of the most prolific, exciting offenses in the country. Cincinnati's rapid ascension from F.B.S. afterthought to Big East power has been one of the best stories of this decade. Florida is running low after a loss to Alabama in the SEC championship, which prevented the Gators from playing for yet another national championship, but the Gators are clearly one of the best teams in the country. Of course, this is the final collegiate game for quarterback Tim Tebow, who we will all miss -- whether you want to admit it or not. It may be difficult for both teams to forget about the off-field news, but if we're lucky, once this game gets underway we will see two of the top teams in the nation.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Reorganization Meeting Addresses Budget Woes", "kicker": "The Local - Maplewood"}, "snippet": "New Year's Day reorganization meeting celebrates Maplewood's community strengths amidst budget woes.", "abstract": "New Year's Day reorganization meeting celebrates Maplewood's community strengths amidst budget woes.", "lead_paragraph": "Vic DeLuca was officially appointed Maplewood's mayor and Kathleen Leventhal and Gerard Ryan were sworn in as township committee members for 2010 in a noon, New-Year's-Day reorganization meeting at Town Hall.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "The Homeland Secretary's Job Security", "kicker": "Opinionator"}, "snippet": "Was Napolitano's 'The system worked' this administration's 'Heckuva job, Brownie'?", "abstract": "Was Napolitano's 'The system worked' this administration's 'Heckuva job, Brownie'?", "lead_paragraph": "Two newspapers in one!*", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Overlooking the Frail Years", "kicker": "The New Old Age"}, "snippet": "Why is the prospect of disability and illness more difficult to imagine than death?", "abstract": "Why is the prospect of disability and illness more difficult to imagine than death?", "lead_paragraph": "\"I have something I want to talk to you about,\" Jonelle Patrick's father said partway through a visit to her home in San Francisco.
