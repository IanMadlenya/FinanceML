For Ohio State, this game presents another shot at redemption. The Buckeyes have become a punchline for bowl season incompetence because of their three consecutive B.C.S. setbacks, including losses to Florida and L.S.U. in consecutive national championship games. For Oregon, the Rose Bowl can serve as another high note in a year to remember. Before we forget, these Ducks experienced what looked to be a monumental defeat in the season opener against Bose State; I can admit I thought Oregon would not recover from that 19-8 loss. Recover it did, and its enters this game with a very good chance at winning the program's first Rose Bowl since 1917.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Is 'Community Rating' in Health Insurance  Fair?", "kicker": "Economix"}, "snippet": "Exploring the concept of what is fair when it comes to health insurance premiums.", "abstract": "Exploring the concept of what is fair when it comes to health insurance premiums.", "lead_paragraph": "Uwe E.
