The average fan only reads or hears a small fraction of the conversations taking place, but my e-mail inbox has had to contain most of them. The wonderful N.F.L. media operation provides countless transcripts of news conferences and interviews going on during the media availability periods, which concluded with the coaches' and Commissioner Goodell's news conferences Friday. The transcript of Goodell's news conference was the 355th news release, most of which are transcripts of player interviews. To make sure that all that work (and all that paper) doesn't go to waste, here is a sampling of the best quotes of the week.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank":
