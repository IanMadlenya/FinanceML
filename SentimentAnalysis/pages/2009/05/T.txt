But a different kind of experience can apparently be found in New Zealand, according to a story in the Washington Post Travel section this past Sunday, in which the author wrote about trekking the Queen Charlotte Track. The Queen Charlotte Track, located on the South Island, is sometimes compared to the Appalachian Trail, but as Angus Phillip wrote, \"The Queen Charlotte Track is to the Appalachian Trail what the Ritz-Carlton is to a homeless shelter.\" Among its calling cards: easy access to overnight lodgings like the No Road Inn, in which for about the equivalent of $240 a night, you get a spacious room with a flat-screen TV, terrycloth robes and \"a steaming hot tub made from an old wine barrel,\" as well as superbly prepared meals, including a boxed lunch to take with you when you head off toward your next refueling (and pampering) spot. Mr. Phillip does point out that there are less expensive lodging options for hikers who insist on roughing it, but that he prefers \"walking in the finest way, with full stomachs, no heavy packs on our backs, soft beds and crisp sheets waiting. It sure beats the Appalachian Trail.\"", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Cretaceous-Era Decor", "kicker": "City Room"}, "snippet": "Two rare skulls belonging to a 65-million-year-old Triceratops and a smaller relative of the Tyrannosaurus Rex are being auctioned by Bonhams & Butterfields.", "abstract": "Two rare skulls belonging to a 65-million-year-old Triceratops and a smaller relative of the Tyrannosaurus Rex are being auctioned by Bonhams & Butterfields.", "lead_paragraph": "Updated, 6:40 p.m. | Just in time for the new \"Night at the Museum\" film, two rare skulls belonging to a 65-million-year-old Triceratops and a smaller relative of the Tyrannosaurus rex were auctioned on Monday afternoon at Bonhams & Butterfields in Manhattan.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Showcase: A High Schooler Views Her Community", "kicker": "Lens"}, "snippet": "Deondra Scott, 18, photographs her neighbors in Montgomery, Ala.
