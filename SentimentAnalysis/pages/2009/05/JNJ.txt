Starting second on the grid, Stoner shot off the line into the lead. The track was still damp when the race started, but as it dried, several riders cycled to the front, including Rossi. By the middle of the race, Stoner pushed his way back into the lead and began pulling away. It was only in the later stages of the race that Rossi and his Yamaha teammate, Jorge Lorenzo, returned to podium positions, with Lorenzo finishing second and Rossi third. Afterward, Stoner said he had problems with his clutch, and thought the faulty clutch might end his race. \"I just tried adjusting it as much as I could, and we got to a point where it started to grab again and go,\" Stoner told Autosport. \"Then we started having the bike lock up coming into corners because we'd adjusted the clutch too far in. It was really, really difficult to ride.\" Meanwhile Rossi blamed tire choice (and his team) for his third-place finish, Agence France-Presse reported: \"In the dry we made a mistake in going with the hard tires. The choice of hards was made even though I wanted the soft ones.\"", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"seo": "Accounts, People & Miscellany", "main": "Accounts, People & Miscellany", "sub": "Accounts ;", "print_headline": "Accounts, People & Miscellany"}, "snippet": "Accounts.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "Accounts.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "value": "Advertising and Marketing", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "value": "Executives and Management", "name": "subject"}]}, {"headline": {"kicker": "The Caucus", "main": "Despite Critics, Judge May Find Votes in G.O.P.", "sub": "The Opposition ;", "print_headline": "Despite Critics, Judge May Find Votes in G.O.P.", "content_kicker": "The Caucus"}, "snippet": "Early reviews of the Obama presidency agree that he has more successfully changing policy than Washington\u2019s culture, but he has begun altering that narrative.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "Early reviews of the Obama presidency agree that he has more successfully changing policy than Washington\u2019s culture, but he has begun altering that narrative.", "keywords": [{"value": "Obama, Barack", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Republican Party", "is_major": "N", "rank": "2", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Sotomayor, Sonia", "is_major": "N", "rank": "3", "name": "persons"}, {"value": "Supreme Court", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "United States Politics and Government", "is_major": "N", "rank": "5", "name": "subject"}]}, {"headline": {"seo": "Johnson Edges Stewart With Two Laps Left at Dover", "main": "Johnson Edges Stewart With Two Laps Left at Dover", "print_headline": "Johnson Edges Stewart in Final Laps", "content_kicker": "Roundup"}, "snippet": "Jimmie Johnson nosed past Tony Stewart with two laps left in a thrilling battle to the finish and won the Autism Speaks 400 at Dover International Speedway.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "Jimmie Johnson nosed past Tony Stewart with two laps left in a thrilling battle to the finish and won the Autism Speaks 400 at Dover International Speedway.", "keywords": [{"rank": "1", "is_major": "N", "value": "Automobile Racing", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "11", "is_major": "N", "value": "Earnhardt, Dale Jr", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "2", "is_major": "N", "value": "National Assn of Stock Car Auto Racing", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "3", "is_major": "N", "value": "Johnson, Jimmie", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "4", "is_major": "N", "value": "Stewart, Tony", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "5", "is_major": "N", "value": "Autism", "name": "subject"}, {"rank": "6", "is_major": "N", "value": "Autism Speaks", "name": "organizations"}, {"rank": "7", "is_major": "N", "value": "Biffle, Greg", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "8", "is_major": "N", "value": "Kenseth, Matt", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "9", "is_major": "N", "value": "Busch, Kurt", "name": "persons"}, {"rank": "10", "is_major": "N", "value": "Gordon, Jeff", "name": "persons"}]}, {"headline": {"seo": "Two Balanchines Separated by a Peter Martins at the David H.
