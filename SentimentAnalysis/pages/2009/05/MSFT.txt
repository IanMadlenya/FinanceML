Please call the funeral parlor for New Jersey Shiva information. Although he graduated from Newport News High School in Virginia during a brief family business venture, he was mostly a native New Yorker until moving to New Jersey with his wife Marilyn Umlas Wachtel just in time for Op-Sail. He was a consummate businessman forming his own corporation, Wachtel Mechanical Services. He also was President of the Chock Full of Nuts Franchise Owners Association which he helped set up. Among other business ventures, he expanded into the areas of fire protection services and with his wife owns Action Sprinkler Systems and Goldman Fire Prevention. Allan liked to travel, discuss world affairs and read mysteries and adventure novels and loved to \"tune-out\" by watching violent movies. Allan had a heart of gold and a soft underbelly, lending money to friends or getting them jobs and helping them stay out of trouble, while maintaining a slightly porcupine exterior. All who know him understood they could count on him whenever he gave his word. He is survived by his wife, Marilyn and the in-laws on that side, Robert and Judy Umlas and their children Jared, Stefanie and her fiance Shaun.
