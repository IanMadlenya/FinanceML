In several states the alliance held rallies and news conferences and showed commercials, all meant to shore up sympathetic legislators -- and put pressure on less sympathetic ones. At least one event marked a significant shift on Capitol Hill: a Blue Dog Democrat came out in unambiguous support for a government-run \"public option\" for health insurance.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Gokivo Takes a Turn for the Better", "kicker": "Gadgetwise"}, "snippet": "A new version of the Gokivo navigation app is simplified, faster and a marked improvement on the original.", "abstract": "A new version of the Gokivo navigation app is simplified, faster and a marked improvement on the original.", "lead_paragraph": "Gokivo, the first turn-by-turn navigation app for the iPhone, is offering a new version to today, and it's a noticeable improvement from the first.

Tampa Bay co-owner Len Barrie is accused of misappropriating funds from his British Columbia golf resort to help pay for his purchase of the Lightning. According to a report from the Bear Mountain Resort's former accounting firm, Barrie used at least $2.5 million to help pay for the club as part of a number of transactions the firm says may have been \"improper and, in some cases, illegal.\" The Globe and Mail reports that Allan Neale, a partner at the firm who served as the resort's auditor, expressed his concerns to resort management and resigned from the job. Barrie, who is involved in an ownership and payment dispute with Tampa partner Oren Koules that is being mediated by Commissioner Gary Bettman, denies the accusation and tells the newspaper that the resort's new auditing company \"agrees with how I've done it so I don't think there is any issue.\"\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Ice Edge Holdings, one of three bidders for the bankrupt Phoenix Coyotes, has booked ice at Saskatoon's Credit Union Centre to stage five Coyotes games if the group's $150 million bid wins the Sept. 10 auction for the team.

Melnyk, who was outraged last week when Balsillie's lawyers pointed out that Melnyk had paid fines for securities violations, says he long ago advised Balsillie, \"I don't think you knock the door down to try to get a team.\" Melnyk's comments come on the eve of a key Sept. 2 hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix in which Judge Redfield T. Baum is expected to rule on whether Balsillie can participate in the Sept. 10 auction for the Coyotes.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Former N.H.L. Players Association director of business affairs Vincent Damphousse says that union head Paul Kelly was dismissed Monday morning because of \"a kind of paranoia in the group.\" Damphousse, who left his union job a few months before Kelly came aboard in 2007, characterizes the firing as the latest chapter in a struggle within the N.H.L.P.A. membership between hardliners and accommodationists. Damphousse says there is a push to leave behind Kelly's cooperative stance with league management and return to the confrontational approach of Bob Goodenow, who headed the union for 13 years culminating in the 2004-05 lockout.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  Newman, Edward G."}, "snippet": "NEWMAN--Edward G.
