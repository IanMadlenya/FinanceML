Just when it seemed like Virginia Tech could assume that role, it lost running back Darren Evans (1,265 yards as a freshman) to a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Even with Evans on the sideline, the Hokies are still the team to beat. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor seems poised for a breakout season. The Hokies also have a typically nasty defense led by end Jason Worilds and cornerback Stephan Virgil. Virginia Tech faces Alabama (in Atlanta) and hosts Nebraska in the first three weeks of the season. How the Hokies do in those games will speak to where the conference stands. Georgia Tech running back Jonathan Dwyer is a Heisman candidate in Paul Johnson's dangerous spread-option attack. Miami finished one game back in the division last season and ought to be better this year. North Carolina might be a season away from competing for a title. In the Atlantic Division, quarterback Christian Ponder and a veteran offensive line make Florida State the favorite.
