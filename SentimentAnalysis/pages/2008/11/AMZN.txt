Founded by his father William (Dutch) Nolan in 1920, it was the first children's glove company in the US. He served as President from 1960 to 1999. It was his tremendous dedication and hard work that sustained the company successfully into the fourth generation of Nolan's. His reputation in business as a man of honor remains a legend to this day. He loyally served in the Army Air Force in England, during WWII, providing air traffic control and radio support of the battles of Ardennes and Normandy. He was one of the first American soldiers to track and report the arrival of the V-1 missiles launched by Germany over the English Channel in 1944. Edward was a man of exceptional grace and a courtly gentleman at all times and in all situations. The twinkle in his blue eyes charmed the world and kept it warm. He was married and deeply devoted to his wife of 53 years, Alice Joan Stouges, who predeceased him in 2002. He is survived and missed deeply by his four children: Mary Alice Joss, Edward, Michael and William as well as seven grandchildren and one greatgrandchild.

We mourn the loss of Helmut Friedlaender, our beloved friend, great philanthropist, extraordinary business leader, and masterful book collector. We extend our deepest sympathy to his family. Jane, Chuck, Andy and Libby Klein FRIEDLAENDER--Helmut N. The Board of Directors of AMETEK, Inc. expresses their deepest sorrow at the passing of their esteemed colleague and friend, Helmut, and offers their heartfelt sympathy to his family. Hal was an individual of unquestioned character and integrity. He served as a Director of AMETEK for more than 50 years, and, while his business achievements were impressive, his personal stature is best measured by his public spiritedness and generosity. Hal long and actively supported a wide range of public and private causes. Hal's long association with AMETEK began in 1955, when he was elected to the Board of Directors. Since then, his contributions to AMETEK have been innumerable. Five AMETEK Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers have benefited from his wisdom and counsel during his five decades on its board. His understanding of the business and financial worlds has been an invaluable asset to the Company and its shareholders. Indeed, in its nearly 80-year history, there probably has not been a single individual who has had a greater, or more positive, impact on AMETEK than Hal Friedlaender. FRIEDLAENDER--Helmut N. The family of William and Mary Rosenwald deeply mourn the passing of Helmut N. (Hal) Friedlaender, our partner and advisor, an extraordinary investor and a great man, and we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family. From 1944 through the next 40 years, Hal brilliantly guided the family's investments and investment bank, then known as American Securities Corporation. Hal's goal was to create opportunities with a defined limited risk and an unlimited potential, building such businesses as Western Union International and AMETEK, Inc. We celebrate Hal for his integrity, his values, and his enjoyment of life. We are forever grateful for his visionary guidance and his deep friendship. He continues to inspire us.
