A Monday night game is a rarity for Houston, which has not hosted one since 1994, when the Giants beat the Oilers in Jeff Fisher's first game as Houston's interim coach. (Jack Pardee had been fired a week earlier.) The Jaguars' descent from an 11-5 playoff team to a struggling also-ran has been swift, but it can probably be traced to the crumbling of its offensive line. Jacksonville lost its starting guards to season-ending injuries in Week 1 and played without center Brad Meester for the first six games. While the Jaguars have searched for solutions, David Garrard has been sacked 30 times and Maurice Jones-Drew and Fred Taylor have failed to gain 1,000 yards between them.
