The officers, Board of Directors, and staff of UJA-Federation of New York mourn the loss of Jack Nash, a universally esteemed leader and cherished friend. As co-founder and general partner at Odyssey Partners, Jack was admired for his extraordinary accomplishments in the financial services industry. His exceptional success in business was matched only by his deep devotion to the Jewish community --a commitment he shared with his beloved wife, Helen; his son and daughterin-law, Joshua and Beth; and his daughter, Pamela Rohr, and her husband, George. For decades, Jack was one of America's great philanthropists, contributing his financial acumen and generosity to help millions of people in need and strengthen Israel and Jewish communities throughout the world. His abiding concerns live on in the continuing efforts of his family. Jack served on UJA-Federation's Board of Directors, as Joshua does today. Joshua also serves on our Investment Committee. In addition to their involvement in UJA-Federation, the Nash and Rohr families have been affiliated with several of our beneficiary agencies.
