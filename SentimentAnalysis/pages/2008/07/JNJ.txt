The Board and staff of the Foundation for Child Development (FCD) celebrate the life of its longtime Board member and former Vice-Chair of the Board, Dr. Julius B. Richmond. Dr. Richmond brought his decades of experience in pediatric medicine, academia, and government to FCD's work. A tireless advocate for public health, Dr. Richmond's work on the cognitive development of poor children led to his appointment, in 1965 by President Johnson, as the first national director of Project Head Start, which has now served more than 20 million children. Dr. Richmond was a uniquely effective and compassionate champion in the fight to improve the physical and mental health of our nation's children, as well as their educational opportunities. He powerfully and consistently gave voice to the interrelationship between the health and education of children, demonstrating that both are critical to fostering child wellbeing. All Americans have benefited tremendously from his decades of leadership in advancing healthcare in our country. He was a friend, a mentor, and a sterling example of the true spirit of public service. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his entire family, and we are deeply grateful for all that he taught us and accomplished for America's children. P.
