Founder and Chairman Emeritus of Pennrose Properties, Inc., along with its affiliates Pennrose Management Company and Pennrose Service Company. Acting on his sweeping vision to promote a better quality of living for the residents of affordable housing communities, Mr. Rosenthal launched Pennrose Properties in 1981. It was Mr. Rosenthal's innovative approach, and the belief in power of private initiative partnering with non-profit and community organizations that set Pennrose apart. As one of the first developers in Pennsylvania to effectively utilize the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC), Pennrose is widely considered to have set the industry standards and become one of the Mid-Atlantic region's premier affordable housing developers. For more than thirty years, Mr. Rosenthal has championed the goal of making a profound impact on the lives of lower income families by working to provide meaningful supportive services in a quality, secure and affordable living environment. To date, Pennrose has developed more than 10,000 affordable apartments. Mr. Rosenthal's achievements in rebuilding communities and his sensitive approach to historic building conversions earned him the F. Otto Haas Lifetime Achievement Award from Preservation Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth's only private, nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection of historically and architecturally significant properties. Mr. Rosenthal was also the recipient of Ernst & Young's Greater Philadelphia Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2002. In addition, he served as Vice Chairman of the Urban Land Institute, Delaware Valley Chapter, and was an active participant and member of the Urban Land Institute, Executive Committee. A native New Yorker, Mr. Rosenthal was educated at Williams College, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree. He earned his MBA and Juris Doctor degrees from Cornell University. An ardent supporter of community programs, Mr. Rosenthal served on the boards of many civic organizations and commissions, including the Tri-County Commission, Universal Community Homes, and the Philadelphia Child Guidance Center. He currently had been on the Board of Youth Build Philadelphia, and the Mayor's Office of Community Services, and was Vice Chairman of the Urban Land Institute, Philadelphia District Council. Mr. Rosenthal is survived by his wife, Linda; a brother, Richard and his wife, Julia; a sister, Susan; and nephews-Daniel, Matthew, Andrew, and Peter; and a niece, Sandra.
