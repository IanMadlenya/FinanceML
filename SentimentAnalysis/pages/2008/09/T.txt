Founder and Chairman Emeritus of Pennrose Properties, Inc., along with its affiliates Pennrose Management Company and Pennrose Service Company. Acting on his sweeping vision to promote a better quality of living for the residents of affordable housing communities, Mr. Rosenthal launched Pennrose Properties in 1981. It was Mr. Rosenthal's innovative approach, and the belief in power of private initiative partnering with non-profit and community organizations that set Pennrose apart. As one of the first developers in Pennsylvania to effectively utilize the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program (LIHTC), Pennrose is widely considered to have set the industry standards and become one of the Mid-Atlantic region's premier affordable housing developers. For more than thirty years, Mr. Rosenthal has championed the goal of making a profound impact on the lives of lower income families by working to provide meaningful supportive services in a quality, secure and affordable living environment. To date, Pennrose has developed more than 10,000 affordable apartments. Mr. Rosenthal's achievements in rebuilding communities and his sensitive approach to historic building conversions earned him the F. Otto Haas Lifetime Achievement Award from Preservation Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth's only private, nonprofit organization dedicated to the protection of historically and architecturally significant properties. Mr. Rosenthal was also the recipient of Ernst & Young's Greater Philadelphia Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2002. In addition, he served as Vice Chairman of the Urban Land Institute, Delaware Valley Chapter, and was an active participant and member of the Urban Land Institute, Executive Committee. A native New Yorker, Mr. Rosenthal was educated at Williams College, where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree. He earned his MBA and Juris Doctor degrees from Cornell University. An ardent supporter of community programs, Mr. Rosenthal served on the boards of many civic organizations and commissions, including the Tri-County Commission, Universal Community Homes, and the Philadelphia Child Guidance Center. He currently had been on the Board of Youth Build Philadelphia, and the Mayor's Office of Community Services, and was Vice Chairman of the Urban Land Institute, Philadelphia District Council. Mr. Rosenthal is survived by his wife, Linda; a brother, Richard and his wife, Julia; a sister, Susan; and nephews-Daniel, Matthew, Andrew, and Peter; and a niece, Sandra. Services will be held on Friday, October 3 at 11am, at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, located at 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, New York City. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to Friends of Youth Build Philadelphia, 1231 North Broad Street, 3rd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19122, phone 215627-8671. <br><center><img src=\"http://graphics.nytimes.com/logos/60402458.GIF\"></center>", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  McCarthy, Daniel J."}, "snippet": "McCARTHY--Daniel J.

McCarthy, Jr., noted actuary and former President of the American Academy of Actuaries, died Friday in Manhattan after a very brief illness. He was 70. The cause was stomach cancer. For years, Dan had a New Yorker cartoon in his office that showed a man at a cocktail party trying to impress someone by claiming to be famous if one happened to travel in actuarial circles. Dan was, in fact, famous in actuarial circles as a leader in the field who did much to advance the profession and to serve the insurance industry as a whole. Dan started his career at Equitable Life, where he was asked to try his hand at becoming an actuary. He at first had no idea what an actuary was, but agreed to give it a try. Years later, he taught his children that actuaries \"predict the present financial implications of future contingent events.\" It's no surprise that his six children all went on to professions that were easier to describe. After the Equitable, Dan joined Milliman & Robertson, now Milliman, Inc., which is among the worlds largest independent actuarial and consulting firms with 48 offices around the world. He served as Chairman of the firm for seven years, was President of the American Academy of Actuaries, spent six years as a member of the Actuarial Standards Board, was on the board of the Society of Actuaries, and served as the first International Secretary of the American Academy of Actuaries, traveling all over the world to represent the U.S. actuarial profession at many international organizations. In recent years, he served as Chairman of The Actuarial Foundation, a philanthropic group whose mission is to serve the public by developing education and research programs that harness the talents of actuaries. Dan was also known for advising countless other actuaries, generously sharing his experience with them one-on-one and through his public speaking. In trying to get a handle on what her dad did, one of his daughters once asked Dan what it looked like when he was done with a job. \"It's generally a report that presents an idea,\" he told her. She asked, \"What happens if an idea doesnt come to you?\" He was amused and answered, \"So far, one always has.\" He developed a specialty in demutualization, a term that refers to companies that are customer-owned mutual organizations becoming shareholder-owned stock companies. Dan was involved at various levels in demutualizing over 20 companies. He was referred to by The Life Insurance Council of New York as a \"giant in the insurance industry\" and as an \"extraordinary champion of the actuarial profession\" by the current President of the Academy of Actuaries, Bill Bluhm, who also wrote, \"He was an amazing individual, blessed with a first-rate mind, a great heart, and a vibrant personality. Anyone who ever worked with Dan understood what a pleasure it was to be part of whatever team he was leading. He was a consummate leader, one whose enthusiasm for his profession for life in general was infectious and inspiring.\" Dan never did run out of ideas. Even a brilliant actuary could not have predicted exactly when his own life would end, but he and his family spent a wonderful August together at their vacation home on Lake Winnepesaukee, where he played tennis and golf, went swimming and kayaking, and, probably his favorite activity, took his grandchildren for motorboat rides to get ice cream cones. Dan is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Virginia Miller, of Aberdeen, NJ and Moultonborough, NH, his children, Deirdre Gelinne of Westfield, NJ, Daniel III of Laconia, NH, Justin of Farmingdale, NJ, Anne Knight of Hopkinton, NH, Judith of Summit, NJ, and Elizabeth of Manhattan, 15 grandchildren, and his sister, Elizabeth Daly, of DeWitt, NY. A funeral mass will be held today at 10am at St. Benedict Roman Catholic Church in Holmdel. In lieu of flowers, please make donations in Dans memory at http://mercyfirst.org/.
