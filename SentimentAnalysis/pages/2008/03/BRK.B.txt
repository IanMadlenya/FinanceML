She is survived by her husband, Daniel, who loved her completely, as well as by family and friends who were privileged to know her intelligence, warmth and deep generosity. Her distinguished career in Psychoanalysis comprised a private practice in Manhattan, numerous instructorships, service as a board member of the Philadelphia School of Psychoanalysis and the American Board of Certification of the National Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. Linda's passion for the theater began when she was four years old and her parents took her to see \"Where's Charley?\". Afterwards, she visited Ray Bolger in his dressing room. As an adult, she attended eighty to one hundred shows a year, collected an estimated 2500 playbills and served on the boards of the Atlantic Theater Company and the Shakespeare Society. On May 14, 2007 the Atlantic Theaters Main Stage was re-named in her honor as the \"Linda Gross Theater\" in a tribute to her tireless support, and this day was proclaimed Linda Gross Day by the City Council. She was special and she will be missed. Memorial services will be held on Tuesday, April 1st at 11:00am at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th St., New York, NY 10023.
