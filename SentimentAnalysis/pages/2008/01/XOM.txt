Barbara was a woman of intelligence, passion, creativity and style. She was widely appreciated for her many institutional involvements and contributions, including the Weizmann Institute of Science, which she and her family have supported for over 60 years, the New School University, UJA-Federation, the Israel Museum, the Jewish Museum and Grace Cottage Hospital in Townshend, VT. Barbara attended the University of Chicago and Boston University. She shared a wonderful life for over 30 years with her husband Morris, until his death in 1993. Barbara is survived by their children and spouses, her beloved son John (who predeceased her), Nancy Machinist, Judith Levinson Oppenheimer (John Oppenheimer), Robert B. Machinist (Diane Nabatoff), Joshua Levinson (Shoshana), Adam Levinson (Kimberly), and twelve grandchildren: David and Michael Machinist; Solomon and Abraham Silber; Eve Levinson. Funeral services on Sunday, February 3rd, 1:45pm, Temple Israel, 1901 North Flagler Drive, West Palm Beach, FL. The family will be receiving on Sunday after the interment at 318 N. Woods Road, Palm Beach, FL, and on Tuesday, February 5th, 5-8pm at the Oppenheimer home, 1095 Park Ave. New York, NY. LEVINSON--Barbara. It is with great sadness that the American Committee for the Weizmann Institute of Science mourns the passing of our dear friend and treasured leader, Barbara Levinson, a member of the Board of Governors of the Weizmann Institute and of the Board of Directors of the American Committee, and a longstanding and passionate supporter. Barbara's vision guided the Institute as it opened its doors to the general public and communicated its message to the world. Her deep appreciation of the Institute's scientific work culminated in the establishment of the Barbara and Morris Levinson Visitors Center, the first stop for guests at the beautiful Rehovot, Israel, campus. Together with her late husband Morris, Chairman Emeritus of the American Committee and former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Institute, Barbara gave her time and energy, helping establish the American Committee as one of the most effective philanthropies supporting science research. A member of the American Committee President's Circle, Barbara credited her father, Lou Salvage, for her early interest in the Weizmann Institute. She passed on her enthusiasm to her own family, including her son, Robert Machinist, who served as Chairman of the American Committee. We extend our deepest sympathy to the entire Levinson family. May they be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. We will miss Barbara greatly, but her guiding presence in the Weizmann Institute family will always be felt. Lawrence S. Blumberg Chairman American Committee Pennie Abramson, President American Committee Martin S. Kraar, Exec. V.P. American Committee Mandy Moross, Chair Weizmann Institute Prof. Daniel Zajfman President Weizmann Institute LEVINSON--Barbara.
