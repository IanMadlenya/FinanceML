In a front-page story, Ray Rivera notes that 42 representatives from New York and New Jersey, at least a dozen lease cars on taxpayer money, and their choices run the gamut.Representative Anthony D. Weiner, Democrat of Brooklyn and Queens, drives a 2008 Chevrolet Impala, leased for $219 a month. Representative Michael R. McNulty, a Democrat from the Albany area, gets around in a 2007 Mercury Mariner hybrid, a sport -utility vehicle, for $816 a month. Jim Saxton, a Republican of New Jersey, leases a 2004 Chevy TrailBlazer at $310 a month. Gregory W. Meeks, a Queens Democrat, leases a 2007 Lexus LS 460 at $998 a month. And Charles B. Rangel, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, leases a 2004 Cadillac DeVille for $777.54 a month. The car is 17 feet long with a 300-horsepower engine and seats five comfortably. \"It's one of the bigger Cadillacs,\" Mr. Rangel, of Harlem, said cheerfully this week. \"I've got a desk in it. It's like an airplane.\" (See related graphic.)There are few restrictions on what kind of car the members can choose, and there is no limit on how much they can spend. But the benefit can be politically sensitive, given the growing concerns about automobile emissions and an economy that has left many people struggling to pay for the rapidly rising cost of gas, which was averaging $3.63 a gallon nationwide this week.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Wrigley and the Future of M&A", "kicker": "DealBook"}, "snippet": "Earlier this week, several press reports spun the $23 billion Mars-Wm.
