Widely known in the investment community for his company's authoritative reports on the petroleum industry, died at Connecticut Hospice on August 23, 2008 at age 96. He was a resident of New Canaan, CT for 49 years, recently moving to North Branford. He, with his wife of 72 years, the former Peggy Schusser of Greenwich, enjoyed a long and varied career. Graduating from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University in 1936, he and Peggy moved to the southwestern U.S. where he worked as an explorative geologist for a number of oil companies. His work there was terminated in July 1941 when he was ordered to active duty as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy. Assigned to the U.S.S. William P. Biddle, an amphibious troop transport, he participated in seven amphibious assault operations in the European and Pacific theaters. In late 1944 he returned to the U.S. to commission and assumed command, as a lieutenant commander, of the U.S.S. Waukesha, a 14,000 ton amphibious assault ship. Following various independent operations in the far Pacific, Waukesha joined Task Force 31 to land the first allied seaborne troops on the Japanese homeland on August 30, 1945, followed by occupation of atom-bombed Nagasaki in September. As a civilian John resumed his work as a geologist. In 1948 he organized John S. Herold, Inc., specializing in the preparation and publication of appraisal reports on petroleum companies. He retired in 1984 when he sold his business to Arthur Smith of Houston, TX. He is survived by his wife, Peggy, his children, Susan, John and wife Julie, grandson Christopher and wife Nicole, greatgranddaughters Sadie and Delilah. Sons Robert and David predeceased him. A celebration of John's life will take place at a later time.
