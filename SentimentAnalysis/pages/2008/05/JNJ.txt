Born May 30, 1945 to Robert and Helen Johnson, Keith was raised in Joliet, Illinois, graduated from Harvard University and pursued postgraduate studies at the Universities of Chicago and Pennsylvania where he received a Ph.D. in Economics from the Wharton School in 1979. Keith taught economics at Columbia and NYU and worked in the advisory groups of Townsend-Greenspan & Co., JP Morgan and Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. He \"retired\" in 1996, the better to pursue more theoretical interests in mathematics/econometrics and an equivalent passion for apartment/house remodeling and electric system design applied, in a tradition passed down from his father, for the benefit of family and friends. Keith was a remarkable individual, smart and compassionate well beyond the ordinary. He impacted many lives. He loved, he was loved and he will be missed. Keith is survived by his companion Kathryn Cruze, four brothers, Kent, Carl, Theodore and Glen (Deborah), a sister Ellen (Tim) Johnson-Caspar, two sons Jamil and Omar (Beth) Albertelli, an aunt, Betty Neiswender, numerous beloved nephews, nieces and grandchildren, Aria and Sarina.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "The Quad Countdown: No 89 Middle Tennessee State", "kicker": "The Quad"}, "snippet": "The Blue Raiders are hoping to return to the top of the Sun Belt Conference, but they still aren't sure where their points are going to come from.", "abstract": "The Blue Raiders are hoping to return to the top of the Sun Belt Conference, but they still aren't sure where their points are going to come from.", "lead_paragraph": "Location: Murfreesboro, Tenn.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"seo": "Kicked Out of the Play Group -
