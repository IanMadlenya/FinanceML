March 25, 1927-May 24, 2008, a life-long business entrepreneur, philanthropist and friend to a wide range of civic, charitable and political organizations, died Saturday, May 24, 2008 at age 81. Mr. Moldaw, a loving husband, father and grandfather, is survived by his wife Phyllis, daughters Carol and Susan Moldaw, and four grandchildren. His wife and family were able to be with him during his illness and final hours of life. Mr. Moldaw, a pioneer in the specialty retail and clothing business, founded Ross Dress for Less in 1982 and was a founding investor in The Gymboree Corporation in 1986. Ross Stores is a Fortune 500 company with more than 900 locations, and Gymboree is a leading children's clothing and activity brand with 585 stores in the United States and Canada. Mr. Moldaw served as the Chairman of the Board at Ross Stores for more than a decade, and as Chairman Emeritus, he remained an active board member. He also was Chairman Emeritus of The Gymboree Corporation, and cofounded U.S. Venture Partners, a Menlo Park based venture capital firm. Mr. Moldaw started his first company, Country Casuals, in 1958 in Palo Alto, California, and went on to develop a successful retail presence based on a passion for customer service, a belief in distinctive marketing and a drive for competitive pricing. He was known for his foresight into customer preferences and for recognizing and fostering the strengths of his business partners and associates. Mr. Moldaw was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and spent his childhood in Brookline. His father was a Russian immigrant who came to the United States amid his homelands civil war. In 1944, Mr. Moldaw enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was called to active duty aboard a troop transport ship, the Ulysses S. Grant. After the war, he attended Syracuse University on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in Marketing and Economics. While attending Syracuse, he met his future wife, Phyllis Israelson of Portland, Maine. They married in August 1950. Soon after graduating college, he went to work for the Le Bon Marche, a department store in Lowell, Massachusetts, and later G. Fox & Co., a specialty department store in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1955, he moved to California to take a job with Lerner Shops, and he went on to open more than 20 Lerner stores during the late 1950s. Always entrepreneurial, he gave his notice at Lerners in the spring of 1959 and struck out entirely on his own. Beyond his business accomplishments, Mr. Moldaw was a great believer in people and what they could accomplish in life. \"He was an unforgettable man a visionary, entrepreneur, leader and philanthropist,\" said Norman Ferber, chairman of Ross Stores. Mr. Moldaw served on the boards of many San Francisco Bay Area non-profit groups, including the Moldaw-Zaffaroni Boys and Girls Club of East Palo Alto, REDF, Communities in Schools, the Jewish Community Endowment Fund and the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. He was a member of the Board of Trustees of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The San Francisco Ballet and KQED, and a leading supporter of 899 Charleston, a seniors living center in Palo Alto. In politics, he was a longtime, active Democrat who was appointed by President Clinton as a Public Delegate to the U.S. Mission at the United Nations in 1993 and as Chairman of the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars in 1996. In 2000, Gov. Gray Davis appointed Mr. Moldaw to chair California's World Trade Commission, and two years later to a serve as commissioner on the states Little Hoover Commission. In 2006, Mr. Moldaw captured his personal story in a book titled A Life Story For My Grandchildren. He wrote: \"My greatest happiness came not from money and possessions but from engagements, accomplishments, challenges, the camaraderie with the people I have met along the way, and the love of my family. I also hope that my grandchildren will come to understand the joy of helping their less fortunate fellows to fulfill their dreams. We can do so much to make the world a better place. The advantage of financial wellbeing can make a person indulgent, rob him of the true measure of meaningful accomplishment and allow him to live a shallow life; or it can give him the ability to make a difference in the world that cries out for compassion, action and commitment.\" Mr. Moldaw's family is planning a private service. A memorial celebration of his life will take place at a later date. The family requests that any memorial gifts be made to The Moldaw-Zaffaroni Boys and Girls Club of East Palo Alto, Eastside College Preparatory School, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and The Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco. <br><center><img src=\"http://graphics.nytimes.com/logos/60402008.GIF\"></center>", "keywords": []}], "meta": {"hits": 852, "offset": 0, "time": 54}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
