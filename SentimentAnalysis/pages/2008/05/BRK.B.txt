A command pilot with more than 7000 flying hours to his credit, General Close was born in Columbus, Ohio and raised in New York City and Los Angeles. This graduate of Beverly Hills High School and Stanford University joined the Army Air Corps in 1939, earned his wings and commission at Kelly Field, Texas, and subsequently went on to a distinguished military career which included flying \"the hump\" in the China-Burma-India theater as a B-29 squadron commander and leading B-29s out of the Mariana Islands as a group operations officer in 1945. General Close returned from World War II after 600 combat hours and 35 missions. In 1952 he commanded the 98th Bomb Wing at Yokota Air Base, Japan where he flew 21 more combat missions over Korea. During the Cold War the General played an integral role in the Strategic Air Command and Operation Looking Glass. His career culminated with his command of JT2 at Sandia Base, New Mexico, working directly under the Joint Chiefs. The General retired in 1968, and moved with his wife, the former Joan Millsop of Weirton, West Virginia, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, where this former college polo and tennis player found time to express his athleticism as a Champion golfer. General Close was preceded in death by his wife of 55 years in 1998. He is survived by his four daughters: Leslie Joan Close of Bellevale, NY; Christine Campbell of Colorado Springs; Joey Close Baffico of Montclair, NJ; Barbara Vote of Hillsboro, Oregon; and, five grandchildren.
