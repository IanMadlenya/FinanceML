Born in Kansas City on December 10, 1921 to a prominent family in the area since the early 1800's. His family fortune was wiped out in the Depression and still only a boy; John found five jobs while going to school when most men couldn't find one. As a young man, he started out as a cashier for the securities firm of Harris, Upham. One day, he was asked to fill in for a stock trader who was sick. Though shy, he quickly showed he was a natural born trader \"not a charts and research\" trader but a visceral trader whose great instinct would benefit many people, for decades to come. In 1954, Big John was a managing partner of Uhlmann & Latshaw, which then merged with EF Hutton & Co. making him the youngest partner in Hutton's history. He rose to become Executive Vice President, managing director, member of the executive committee and director of E.F. Hutton Inc., the E.F. Hutton Group and E.F. Hutton International and his opinions on the economy have been widely quoted, and he was an oft-requested speaker. When most men retire, he did and became the Chairman of the Board, and Chief Executive Officer of B.C. Christopher & Company. Later, he left the brokerage business to become Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and owner of what he named Latshaw Enterprises, Inc., which included Latshaw Tools, Wescon Products Company, Anderson & Forrester, Coast Wire & Plastic Tech, Inc., and MC Electronics, and held positions at numerous other ventures. Civic duty ran in his family and President Harry Truman, who was friends with his uncle, Judge Latshaw, befriended him as a young man so John was always involved in politics not just as a contributor for local, state and national races but by devoting his time for his friends who ran for state office or working on national campaigns such as: running the Re-elect Nixon campaign for Missouri and Kansas for the landslide victory in 1972. Later, he was National Chairman of Democrats for Ford as he was, in fact, a life-long Democrat, which illustrates his independent spirit and preference for people not adherence to rigid ideas and he was a great supporter on both sides of the aisle. He was appointed His Majesties' Royal Thai Consul to the United States by His Majesty the King of Thailand. Years later, in 1983, at Saranrom Palace, Bangkok, Thailand, Mr. Latshaw was decorated by the Prime Minister of Thailand with the Chaturathabhorn of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant Award, the highest award given to a civilian, in honor of their contributions to Thailand. A decade later, he was decorated with The Knight Commander of the Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand at the Thai Embassy in Washington, D.C. He was also honored and made a Knight Hospitalier of Malta by the Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem. He received the Citation of Merit for Outstanding Achievement and Meritorious Service in Business and Public Administration in 1957, the first year such an award was given by the University of Missouri. On April 30, 1970, in the U.S. Senate, he was given the Golden Eagle Award for \"defending the principles of capital formation, achievements in business and civic action, and full dedication of economic freedom in all its broad humanity\". His interests were not limited to finances or politics so with his friend, Lamar Hunt, he helped bring the unknown sport of soccer to the United Sates, forming the North American Soccer League and his team, the Kansas City Spurs, won the first championship. He was part of the introduction of cable television to the United States and as chairman, formed a coalition of civic leaders to create the fifth largest cable operation in the United States, American Cablevision. His exceptional dynamism and talent enabled him to serve on an unusual number of organizations and charitable causes among which: the NASA Advisory Board to the President of the United States, 1983-1986; He was member of the Exec. Board of the Religious Heritage of America Executive Board, Invest-in-America A member of the Society of Fellows- the Nelson Gallery of Art; and the Chairman- Board of Trustees the Conservatory of Music. He was truly \"larger than life\". When asked how tall he was, he would wryly reply \"five foot-twenty\". Yet it was not due to his stature but because of the kind person he was that everyone called him \"Big John\". He was a loyal friend, an inspiration to his co-workers, and was a mentor to many. He was an innovative thinker who refused to quit. He loved life and lived by his motto of \"making money and having fun - but not one without the other\" and made life, frankly, just more fun. A gentleman with a delightful sense of humor, and an impish grin, he always had a twinkle in his eye. In his teens, he could clear the dance floor but even at the end of his life, he could still make women swoon as they fondly recalled, \"he was the best dancer\". He was well known throughout the world but always proud to be from Kansas City - a city he loved so much and supported, and his adopted home of Naples, Florida. He was preceded in death by his parents, Edna Parker Latshaw and Ross W. Latshaw; his son, Henry John Latshaw III; his brothers, Parker Latshaw, Robert Latshaw, and sister, Mercedes Anderson. He leaves behind his two daughters: Lady Jaffray, Constance, and Elizabeth Albright Latshaw.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  PEABODY, JUDITH "}, "snippet": "PEABODY--Judith.
