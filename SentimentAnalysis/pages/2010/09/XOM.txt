He was born in Troy, New York to Lulu and Hyman Marks. He was a graduate of the University of Michigan and Harvard Law School. In 1942, after a year at the law school, he enlisted in the navy, as the communications officer on a destroyer in the north Atlantic and the Mediterranean. When the war ended in Europe he was transferred to the Pacific. He had in his possession the maps that were to be used in the invasion of Japan. The destroyer got as far as Pearl Harbor when the war ended. He returned to Harvard, graduating in 1947. In that year he married Paulina Konoff whom he had met in Cambridge. After a year as a lawyer for the Department of Agriculture dealing with maritime law he joined the family businesses, Conmar Products Corp., manufacturers of zippers, and Margon Corporation, manufacturers of moving eyes for dolls, both in Newark, NJ. From the 1970's to the 1990's he was the president of Measurex, a supplier of specialty measures for the food, drug, and chemical industries. The Marks family lived in New York until 1957 when they moved to Short Hills, NJ, and in 2000 moved to South Orange. In addition to his business interests, Mr. Marks was a founding member of the ACLU of New Jersey, now celebrating it's 50th year. He was treasurer for at least two decades. In the mid 1970's he joined the board of Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, becoming chair two years later. He served as chair for 16 years, in two terms. From the very beginning he felt his service on the Beth board was the most exciting and fulfilling association ever. He was the most honorable, fairest, and kindest of men. Mr. Marks is survived by his wife of almost 63 years, Paulina, his three children Lucy, Edward, and Paul, his son-in-law Scott Sprinzen, his grandsons Alexander and Leo Sprinzen and Jacob and Ethan Marks, and his sister Margery Howard. He was predeceased by his brother John. He was a loving uncle to the Bromberg, Hamerman, Marks and Howard families. Contributions in his memory may be made to the ACLU of New Jersey Foundation or to the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center Foundation.
