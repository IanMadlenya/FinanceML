I went into the backstage, more like a bunker with long tables and mirrors, and Pat McGrath and her makeup artists were working on the models. It was 5:40 p.m. I said hello to Franca Sozzani, who was also killing time, and then I went in search of Alber Elbaz. Since there was a good sense of show panic, I got past the security guard at the dressing room entrance without any difficulty, and I heard Mr. Elbaz before I actually saw him.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Arts & Leisure Preview: Katherine Heigl, Janis Joplin, T.

We look back at Design Research, the revered godfather of modern design stores. Pilar Viladas visits an airy, open house in Italy by the superstar designer Patricia Urquiola for Patrizia Moroso, the creative director of the cutting-edge furniture company Moroso, while Nicolai Ouroussoff considers a very different dwelling: a seven-sided house in Southern California, by the Los Angeles architect Michael Maltzan for the artists Lari Pittman and Roy Dowell, which spirals around an intimate courtyard, looking inward rather than out. Our Profile in Style focuses on Barnaba Fornasetti, the scion of a legendary design family who has made his own kind of magic. Alexandra Lange spends time with Renate M\u00fcller, the German designer of meticulously crafted, whimsical therapeutic toys, and Judith Nasatir peers into the exquisite world of Federico de Vera, the gimlet-eyed proprietor of one of New York's most magical design shops. On an entirely different note, Jaime Gross takes a peek at a San Francisco medical marijuana dispensary that is as elegantly designed as any fashion store-bringing an often taboo subject out of the shadows.
