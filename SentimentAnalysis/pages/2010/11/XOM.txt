At the time of his death, Mr. Bouma was Senior Counsel at the Chicago-based law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP, where he had served on the Management Committee and chaired the Litigation department. He was born the son of Jack and Gladys Cooper Bouma on July 19, 1938, and grew up in Pocahontas, IA. Mr. Bouma, an outstanding high school athlete, was selected All-State in both football and basketball. He went on to Coe College, where he excelled in both sports, and on whose Board of Trustees he later served for many years. At the University of Iowa Law School, he was an editor of the Iowa Law Review. Upon graduation in 1962, he joined Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York as an associate, during which time he also served as a Lieutenant in the JAG Corp. of the United States Naval Reserve.

Mr. Bouma loved art, especially the American realist Marvin Cone. He assembled a diverse collection of Canton porcelain and was an avid reader of art and antique magazines. His greatest loves were playing tennis with his family and spending time at his cabin near Pocahontas hunting pheasants with his son Jim and his brother John, a leading Arizona attorney. Mr. Bouma, together with his wife Susan, raised his family in Lake Forest, IL. He was a most loving and caring father and an inspiration and guide to not just his children, but to many in his personal and professional life. He is survived by the love of his life, Susan Lawson Bouma, son Jim, daughter Whitley Clare, son-in-law David Donnelly Herbert, and grandson, Lawson. Robert and Susan Bouma were to celebrate their 47th wedding anniversary on November 26. He was a member of the John's Island Club and the Onwentsia Club. \"Bob was a vibrant leader of McDermott and part of our backbone for the many years he was our friend and colleague,\" said Jeffrey E. Stone, Co-Chair of McDermott Will & Emery. \"Our lives were made better because Bob's irrepressible spirit and unlimited vitality touched and inspired all of us. He pushed us all to be better - and because of him we were. He will be greatly missed by all in the McDermott family.\" A Memorial Service will be held on Friday, December 3, at 3pm at The First Presbyterian Church of Lake Forest, 700 North Sheridan Rd, Lake Forest, IL.
