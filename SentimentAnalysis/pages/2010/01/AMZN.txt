All the lawyers and staff of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP mourn the loss of their partner Bob Joffe, a friend and mentor who was a preeminent litigator and boardroom adviser. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife and family to whom he was so devoted. Mr. Joffe was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August 2009 and died in New York, NY on January 28. He was 66 years old. Over the course of his extraordinary career, Mr. Joffe was well- known nationally and internationally, both for his tenacity in handling landmark litigation and for his ability to provide highly sensitive counsel in the boardrooms of corporate America. Since 1978, Mr. Joffe was the primary outside lawyer for Time Warner. One of the many significant matters he handled was the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. He was the principal litigator for Time Inc. in successfully rebutting Paramount's 1989 attempted takeover in a case considered to be a milestone in M&A litigation. Mr. Joffe represented the Boards of Directors of some of the world's most prominent companies in connection with their most pressing challenges, especially during the recent financial crisis. He was a longtime advisor to the non-management directors of Fannie Mae and was also counsel to the independent directors of Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, General Electric and General Motors, among many others. Mr. Joffe was passionate about human rights even as a student at Harvard Law School. From 1967 to 1969, after just a few months as a Cravath associate, Mr. Joffe left New York to serve in the Ministry of Justice of the Government of Malawi on an Africa Asia Public Service Fellowship funded by the Ford Foundation. It was in this position that he assisted the Commissioner for Law Revision in rewriting the country's laws and instituting a framework for supervision of the local courts for this African country. He continued his interest in civil rights and, in 1989, he argued Martin v. Wilks, a pro bono civil rights case in the United States Supreme Court in which he represented black and women municipal employees in Birmingham, Alabama, in an effort to secure equal opportunity in employment. In later years, as Cravath's Presiding Partner, Mr. Joffe was a strong promoter of the need for lawyers to treat pro bono clients with equal regard and concern as they would any paying client. Mr. Joffe became a partner at Cravath in 1975. He was elected Deputy Presiding Partner in 1997 and became Cravath's Presiding Partner in 1999. Mr. Joffe served as the Firm's leader until December 31, 2006. Mr. Joffe was a beloved and devoted husband, father and son. He is survived by his wife Virginia (Dinny), two children, Katherine Joffe (New York, NY) and David Joffe (New York, NY) and two stepchildren, Dr. Ryan DeHaas (Concord, NC) and Elizabeth DeHass (New York, NY), and two grandchildren. He is also survived by his mother, Bertha Joffe, and two brothers, Paul Joffe (Washington, DC) and Richard Joffe (New York, NY). A memorial service will be held to celebrate his life on Wednesday, February 10th at 11am at All Souls Church, 1157 Lexington Ave. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Human Rights First, 333 Seventh Ave., 13th Floor, New York, NY 10001 or to The After-School Corporation, 1440 Broadway, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10018.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "JOFFE, ROBERT D"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Inside The Times"}, "snippet": "International     IN EGYPT, SECTARIAN CLASHES ARE OFFICIALLY ANYTHING BUT", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "International IN EGYPT, SECTARIAN CLASHES ARE OFFICIALLY ANYTHING BUT", "keywords": []}], "meta": {"hits": 263, "offset": 0, "time": 67}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
