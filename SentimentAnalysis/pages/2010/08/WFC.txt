INGERSOLL -->INGERSOLL--Robert Stephen, a leader in industry, diplomacy, education, and civic institutions as well as a dedicated and loving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, died peacefully on Sunday, August 22, surrounded by his family. Born January 28, 1914 in Galesburg, Illinois to Roy C. Ingersoll and Lulu Hinchliff Ingersoll, he was educated at Phillips Academy, Andover and Yale University. In 1938, he married Coralyn Eleanor Reid Ingersoll (Ellie), best friend and loving wife for 63 years, and together they were life-long residents of the Chicago area. Robert was CEO and Chairman of Borg-Warner Corporation, and a director of numerous corporate boards, including First National Bank of Chicago, Atlantic Richfield Company, Burlington Northern, Caterpillar Inc., Kraft Inc., Marcor Corporation, Royal Group, Inc., and Weyerhaeuser Company. He served The United States of America as Ambassador to Japan and Deputy Secretary of State under the Nixon and Ford Administrations, and was awarded The First Class Order of the Rising Sun, the highest honor awarded to a foreigner, from the Government of Japan. His strong commitment to and belief in education was reflected in his work as Director and Chairman of the Panasonic Foundation, as a life trustee of the University of Chicago, and as trustee of Smith College, California Institute of Technology and the Aspen Institute. Out of his love of nature and the American West, he served as Vice Chairman of the National Parks Foundation and spent most of his vacation time and retirement in Snowmass, CO and Scottsdale, AZ, as well as over 35 summers at Eaton's Ranch in Wolf, WY. An avid harmonica player, and former member of the Yale Glee Club, he was a lover of music and long-time governing member of The Chicago Symphony Orchestra and dedicated member of The Bohemian Grove Club. He is survived by his brother James H. Ingersoll of Florida, daughters, Nancy Reid Ingersoll Foster (married to Francis G. Foster Jr.), Gail Ann Ingersoll Ransom (married to Lawrence Bristol Ransom), and Elizabeth Gaylord Ingersoll Carroll (married to Paul Ingersoll Carroll), eleven grandchildren and twenty-one great-grandchildren as well as numerous nieces and nephews. He is predeceased by his wife Eleanor (d. 2001), and two daughters, Coralyn Eleanor Ingersoll Walker (d. 2003 - married to Robert Giles Walker) and Joan Courtney Ingersoll (d. 1951). In lieu of flowers, gifts may be made to the University of Chicago and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

That question, which has prompted countless academic studies, debates and inter-running-partner squabbles, is now at the heart of a notable new study published in August on the Web site of USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body. The study, one of the largest of its kind, involved almost 1,400 runners, from age 13 to past 60, who were assigned randomly to two groups. The first group did not stretch before their runs, while otherwise maintaining their normal workout routine: the same mileage, warm-up (minus any stretching) and so on. The second group stretched, having received photographs and specific instructions for a series of simple, traditional poses, like leaning over and touching toes, that focused on the calf, hamstring and quadriceps muscles. The volunteers were told to hold each stretch for 20 seconds, a technique known as static stretching. The entire routine required three to five minutes and was to be completed immediately before a run.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 873, "offset": 0, "time": 65}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
