His family is deeply saddened by Herb's death. We share this sadness with his countless business friends, golfing buddies, and the many folks Herb and Connie befriended over the years in NYC, Connecticut, Europe and elsewhere. Herb lived a wonderful, passionate life. Growing up in Philadelphia. A loving family life with Connie, Gigi and Peter in Westchester. His business success in the menswear world in New York City. Building a company with vision and foresight, Herb was a larger-than life presence, mentoring, encouraging, leading. Herbert R. Aronson was born on May 30, 1921, in Burlington, NJ, one of three children for Rebecca and Joseph. He grew up in a modest household, the son of shop owners. Herb \"Reds\" Aronson wasn't much of a student, but he loved playing basketball, starring at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia in the late 1930s. He wore number 13, a number later made famous at Overbrook by a player named Wilt Chamberlain. Herb was a flag-waving member of \"America's Greatest Generation,\" a World War II vet who served in England with the U.S. Army Air Corps as an airplane radio mechanic. After the war, he returned to Philadelphia, attending night school at Penn, working in a shoe store and... playing cards with his buddies. And he met Connie. Never one to tread lightly, at a dinner dance, Herb intentionally spilled a drink on Connie's date to get rid of him, so he could meet Connie. They were married on August 24, 1950 Herb was a travelling salesman at the time, eking out a living. Soon after, the couple moved to New York City, where Herb would make his life's mark in the menswear business, manufacturing and selling ties. Herb worked as a salesman for his father-in-law Joseph Wollman. He was not paid enough, so he set off on his own in the heart of the garment district. He bought into a partnership by borrowing $20,000. Soon, Berkley Cravats Ltd. was flourishing, with Herb as chief stylist, buyer and salesman. With a larger than life presence and a natural ease at making friends, Herb befriended and endeared himself to industry leaders across Europe, buying the finest silks, cottons and woolens. With vision, Herb pushed silk paisley ties, bold stripes and introduced English Rugby shirts to America. He travelled the country selling. Store buyers found it hard to say no to Herb Aronson. Beautiful ties. Sound craftsmanship. A good price. Perhaps a little table pounding. But what really sold the ties was Herb's personality - his passion for his business, and the simple fact that store executives, including countless presidents and CEOs, grew to respect and love Herb Aronson. By the early 1970s, Berkley Cravats was booming. But Herb had a problem. His partner didn't work hard enough. Herb arranged to sell the company to Manhattan Industries. Herb's partner got a nice pay-off and a Florida retirement. Herb became president and CEO of a new, larger company built around his original tie company, The Manhattan Accessory Division, manufacturing and selling ties, belts and wallets. Manhattan Shirts was added to the portfolio. So was Perry Ellis. Herb's ties were made of Liberty of London's cotton; Como, Italy's silk; the UK's woven fabrics. As president and CEO of Manhattan Menswear Group and, later, as executive VP of Salant Corp. (after it bought Manhattan Industries), with the help of many colleagues who would become life-long friends, Herb built a multi-million dollar business. But more important than the bottom line was the respect Herb earned because of his dedication, passion and friendship, and his strong desire and willingness to help others. Herb loved to help others. He was a mentor to many executives in the menswear field, quick to make a phone call to help someone get a job. When an employee didn't have money to fly home for a relative's funeral, Herb bought the man a plane ticket. Herb proudly served on the Board of Directors for the Greater New York Councils of Boy Scouts, the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, and the Hampshire House co-op. He is a past president of the Neckwear Association of America Herb helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for charities and was honored for this work by the Boy Scouts of America with the Good Scout Award and later with the Silver Beaver Award. The United Jewish Appeal and the Conference of Christians and Jews both gave Herb a Man of the Year Award. He also was honored by the Neckwear Association of America and the Young Men's Association. Despite his hard work, Herb Aronson was a dedicated and loving husband to Connie and father to Gigi and Peter. Herb encouraged and loved Connie's beautiful paintings. They travelled widely, making life-long friends in Europe. He could not have been more proud of his children - Gigi, the retail executive, then school teacher, Peter the journalist turned lawyer. Herb supported Gigi and Peter, always offering an ear to listen and a shoulder to lean on. Sometimes his opinions were strong, but this was Herb, never shy about giving the advice he thought best. Herb relished the energy, individuality and success of his grand kids: Seth, the soon-to-be law school graduate; Alex, the Peace Corps volunteer and future law school student; Mabel, the spunky, artistic second grader; and little Maisy, the precocious pre-schooler with Herb's red hair for life. Herb adored Peter's wife, Emily, and Gigi's husband, Chuck, happy that his children had found wonderful mates for life. Herb is also survived by his older sister, Florence, who he loved. Herb left his impact on all of us with his love and enduring passion for life and his will and encouragement for achievement. We will remember his supportive words, his strong embrace, his wonderful smile, his sweet kiss. We will remember his love forever. His memorial service is Sunday, May 2, at 1:30pm at Frank Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Ave.; Reception follows at the Aronson's NYC home. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the Ronald McDonald House of New York, 405 East 73rd St., New York, NY 10021, in memory of Herb.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"seo": "The Fates of Motorola and Palm Diverged Over Android", "main": "How the Destinies of Motorola and Palm Grew Apart", "print_headline": "How the Destinies of Motorola and Palm Grew Apart"}, "snippet": "For much of this decade, the fates of Palm  and Motorola  were intertwined.
