Raised in Tuckahoe, New York, she graduated from Goucher College in 1938. On a return trip to Goucher from Grand Central Station, she met Avery who happened to be there with friends. He was so taken with her that he proceeded to call every \"Cane\" in the Westchester phone book until her found her. They were married on August 9, 1940. Janet was an accomplished and dynamic woman who dedicated her life to the causes she believed in. She was a Board Member of the 92nd St. Y for over 50 years, and a Board Member of Young Audiences Inc., Children's Orchestra Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, and The New Milford Hospital Foundation. She established the Janet and Avery Fisher Music Residency program at Goucher College. Janet and Avery were frequently seen at concerts at Lincoln Center. Classical music was a shared passion. She had warm relationships with many of the young musicians who received Avery Fisher Career Grants or the coveted Avery Fisher Prize. Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax gave private birthday \"concerts\" for her twice, true highlights in her life. Janet loved their Washington, CT home and spent many hours in her gardens. She created beautiful dried flower arrangements and gave them as gifts to her friends. When she was in her seventies, Janet was spotted by a modeling agent as she was bringing an armload of lilacs to her physician. The agent insisted that she was the perfect face for a GAP ad. Janet became the one and only senior citizen to be so featured. True to form, she donated her fee for this work to the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, encouraging awareness of a cause not yet in the public consciousness at the time. Janet is survived by her beloved children, Barbara, Nancy (Marc), Chip (Susan), five grandchildren: Christopher, Philip, Diana, William, and Matthew, and her step-sister Betty. Funeral services will be private. A memorial will be held at a later date. Donations may be made to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts for the benefit of the Avery Fisher Career Grants or to the 92nd Street Y Nursery School.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}], "meta": {"hits": 178, "offset": 0, "time": 52}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
