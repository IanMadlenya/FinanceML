Lakshmi Mittal, the chief executive of the steel company ArcelorMittal, is providing about $24 million for the cost of the structure, with the remaining amount coming from the Greater London Authority. Boris Johnson, the city's mayor, told The Guardian that while some people will say \"we are nuts, we are barmy in the depths of a recession to be building Britain's biggest ever piece of public art,\"
