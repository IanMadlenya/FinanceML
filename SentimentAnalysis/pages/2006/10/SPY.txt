In Virginia and Maryland, for example, black voters do not look like they will be helping Democrats to their usual extent. James Webb, the Democratic Senate candidate in Virginia, is having a hard time gaining the trust of African-Americans there. They won't be supporting Senator George Allen, but they do not like that Mr. Webb once expressed opposition to affirmative action and might have used racial slurs in his youth. In Maryland, some blacks actually are switching sides, with one prominent group of African-American leaders from a D.C. suburb aligning behind Lt. Gov.

Political scientists have long noticed that some white voters tell pollsters that they'll vote for a black candidate, then don't.
