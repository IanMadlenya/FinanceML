In Virginia and Maryland, for example, black voters do not look like they will be helping Democrats to their usual extent. James Webb, the Democratic Senate candidate in Virginia, is having a hard time gaining the trust of African-Americans there. They won't be supporting Senator George Allen, but they do not like that Mr. Webb once expressed opposition to affirmative action and might have used racial slurs in his youth. In Maryland, some blacks actually are switching sides, with one prominent group of African-American leaders from a D.C. suburb aligning behind Lt. Gov. Michael Steele, the black Republican candidate for Senate, instead of the Democrats' Representative Benjamin L. Cardin. However, Mr. Steele is likely to be, at best for the Republicans, an exception, as a new Associated Press poll finds that Republicans' efforts to woo blacks are not particularly successful.One aspect of polling in general will be put to the test in the Tennessee Senate race. Political scientists have long noticed that some white voters tell pollsters that they'll vote for a black candidate, then don't. A victory by Representative Harold Ford Jr., who is black, could signal that white respondents are no longer just saying that they'd vote for a black.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "What if It's a Tie?", "kicker": "The Caucus"}, "snippet": "With polls nail-bitingly close, one possible result is that the Senate will divide 50-50 between the two parties.
