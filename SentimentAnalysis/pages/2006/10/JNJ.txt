Representative Jim Ryun (a Republican whom I have a soft spot for as a former high school runner myself) is suddenly in a close race. This is one of those districts that wasn't on any radar screens just a week ago, but it sure is now, and we changed it all the way from safe Republican to tossup.In Connecticut, Representative Nancy Johnson, a Republican, has had a tough race all year, and recent polling makes it look even more difficult. We changed that one from leaning Republican to tossup. Another state to jump onto a lot of radar screens recently is Idaho.

We changed the rating from safe Republican to leaning Republican, and it is one to keep a closer eye on.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Boom and Bust", "kicker": "The Fifth Down"}, "snippet": null, "abstract": "", "lead_paragraph": null, "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Will America Embrace British Rapper?", "sub": "Lady Sovereign Tries to Make It Big"}, "snippet": "Lady Sovereign, the British rapper, talks about writing her own lyrics and her refusal to compromise her style.
