The gains in pay came as the bank's profit rose 90 percent, to $8.48 billion, largely reflecting its July 2004 acquisition of the Bank One Corporation, which Mr. Dimon ran. Mr. Dimon served last year as chief operating officer, and succeeded Mr. Harrison as chief executive at year-end. Mr. Harrison, 62, and Mr. Dimon, 50, were each given $1 million in salary, an $8.4 million bonus, $12.6 million of restricted stock and other items. J. P.

(REUTERS) Lazard Raises Compensation for Chief to $14.2 Million Lazard, the investment bank, said yesterday that it had paid its chief executive, Bruce Wasserstein, left, $14.2 million last year, nearly five times his compensation in 2004. Mr. Wasserstein's salary was increased to $4.2 million from $3 million in 2004, Lazard said in a regulatory filing.

Lazard's shares have gained 76 percent since Mr. Wasserstein took the firm public, raising $855 million. The company's income doubled to $172 million last year as the pace of mergers worldwide climbed to the highest since 2000. Lazard is based in New York.

(BLOOMBERG NEWS) Freddie Mac Expects to Post 2005 Results in May The mortgage finance company Freddie Mac, emerging from an accounting scandal, said yesterday that it had a strong year in 2005 but acknowledged that it needed to make more progress in its financial controls and reporting. The government-sponsored company, which is a buyer and guarantor of home mortgages, said it expected to report its 2005 results in late May. Freddie Mac had previously planned to report them in March, but it needed more time to institute a new method of valuing some assets, which it said would reduce income by about $200 million. The company, based in McLean, Va., estimated 2005 income at $2.5 billion, down from $2.9 billion in 2004. (AP) Hollinger International Posts a Smaller Loss for 2005 Hollinger International, the newspaper company formerly controlled by Conrad M. Black, reduced its net loss in 2005 to just under $12 million, according to its annual report released yesterday. Revenue fell slightly to $457.9 million for the year ended Dec. 31, down from $464.4 million, as a result of declines in advertising and circulation revenue. The $11.97 million loss is the smallest loss in five years for the company, which at one time was one of the world's biggest newspaper publishers in terms of circulation. However, since its pinnacle in the 1990's, Hollinger has sold most of its papers. Its business is now concentrated on the Sun-Times News Group, which publishes The Chicago Sun-Times and smaller city and suburban papers in the Chicago area.
