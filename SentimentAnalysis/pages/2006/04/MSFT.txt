David G. Thomson's recently published book, ''Blueprint to a Billion: Seven Essentials to Achieve Exponential Growth,'' takes a different approach. Mr. Thomson evaluates patterns shared by what he calls ''blueprint companies'' -- the 387 businesses that have gone public since 1980 and have reached $1 billion in revenue.

Many of them are household names: Microsoft, Starbucks, Google, Nike, Genentech and Staples. Mr. Thomson notes that of the 4,000 publicly traded companies with $30 million to $1 billion in annual revenue, only 30 become billion-dollar businesses each year.
