Clocking in at 80 minutes, this glib, largely uninformative and poorly organized pr\u00e9cis of the post-World War II art scene, with its emphasis on New York in the 1960's and the curator Henry Geldzahler, succeeds neither as history nor as art history. If you want to know about Geldzahler, who in 1960 became a curatorial assistant in the department of American painting and sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (he died in 1994), you would do better if you typed his name into your favorite search engine. If you want to know about art in the 1960's, well, the art critic Arthur Danto is a good place to start. A jumble of contemporary and, frustratingly, undated talking-head interviews, undated archival film material and still photographs, the film opens promisingly. The sculptor John Chamberlain growls about the public in what appears to be a fairly recent interview. (''What will the public think?'' he asks, answering, ''It's their job to catch up.'') The painters Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning offer up words of wit, wisdom and obfuscation from times past. The words ''The Legend of Henry Geldzahler, 1935-1994'' soon appears, as does the man himself, his full-moon face rising. Frank Stella attests to Geldzahler's importance, which isn't very surprising, since the curator included nine of the artist's works in his landmark 1969 show at the Metropolitan, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970.''", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "WHO GETS TO CALL IT ART?
