Investors had anticipated Gazprom would join the index in February as the most heavily weighted stock, ahead of Samsung of South Korea. Investors sold shares based on news that the re-indexing would be delayed until May, said Leonid Mirzoan, an equity analyst at the Moscow office of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment banking firm. Morgan Stanley delayed the re-indexing because Gazprom was slow to increase the free float of its London-traded stock after a restriction on foreign ownership was lifted this year. Mr. Mirzoan blamed a regulatory glitch. Meanwhile, Gazprom, based in Moscow, reported a 67 percent jump in net profit for the quarter ended Sept. 30, largely because of rising natural gas prices.

By PETE THAMEL LOUISIANA STATE RECORD 14-5, 6-0 SEC R.P.I. 20 BIGGEST VICTORY At West Virginia, 71-68, in OT WHY NO HYPE -- For some reason the rankings have been slow to recognize L.S.U., the only undefeated team in the SEC. WHY IT IS HERE -- L.S.U. has always had talent under Coach John Brady, but consistent and cohesive play have often been lacking. This season a blend of youth and experience has clicked. KEY PLAYER -- N.B.A. scouts are buzzing that the unheralded Tyrus Thomas, not the former No. 1- ranked recruit Tasmin Mitchell, could be an N.B.A. lottery pick this year. WISCONSIN-MILWAUKEE RECORD 15-4, 8-1 Horizon R.P.I. 21 BIGGEST VICTORIES St. Louis, Hawaii and at Wyoming WHY NO HYPE -- No hallmark victory early on and a low-profile conference. WHY IT IS HERE -- Bruce Pearl took the Panthers to the Round of 16 last season, then took the Tennessee job. The new coach, Rob Jeter, has continued Pearl's up-tempo style and the Panthers are thriving. KEY PLAYER -- Boo Davis averages 16.5 points, one of three doubledigit scorers. MICHIGAN RECORD 15-3, 5-2 Big Ten R.P.I. 18 BIGGEST VICTORY Michigan State WHY NO HYPE -- Many became skeptical of Tommy Amaker's coaching ability after underachieving with talent at Seton Hall and Michigan. WHY IT IS HERE -- The Wolverines are 10-deep, are among the top 15 nationally in field-goal percentage and are in the top 10 in free-throw percentage. Those are signs of a disciplined and balanced team. KEY PLAYER -- Daniel Horton is averaging 16.5 points and 5.4 assists. AIR FORCE RECORD 17-3, 5-2 Mountain West R.P.I. 46 BIGGEST VICTORIES Miami and Georgia Tech WHY NO HYPE -- Victories over two non-Division I teams water down its record. And the Mountain West is down this season. WHY IT IS HERE -- Nick Welch, the 2004 Mountain West co-player of the year, is out this season with a foot injury. But the rookie coach Jeff Bzdelik has done one of the country's finest coaching jobs. KEY PLAYER -- Bzdelik, who was fired as coach of the Denver Nuggets early last year, has the Falcons' Princeton-style offense clicking. Four players are averaging double digits.

The trial begins today in Houston. A FEW MORE FED MINUTES -- Alan Greenspan turns over the post of Federal Reserve chairman to Ben S. Bernanke tomorrow. Fed policy makers are meeting the same day and are expected to raise interest rates for the 14th consecutive time. Economists say that the Fed may not see the need for more increases in the next few months, an expectation that has helped lift the stock market recently. BY THE BARREL -- Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries begin a meeting in Vienna tomorrow, and ministers have indicated that they are likely to keep pumping oil at current levels. Iran may say, however, that it plans to keep some of its oil off the market in response to criticism of its nuclear efforts. THE JOBS PICTURE -- The major economic news of the week will come on Friday with the release of unemployment figures for January. Also on the list are auto sales for January, due on Wednesday, and retail chain-store sales for January, out on Thursday.
