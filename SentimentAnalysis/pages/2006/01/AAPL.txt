The board and staff of Playwrights Horizons mourn the untimely death of our beloved friend and colleague Wendy Wasserstein. As an artist, Wendy's trailblazing candor, her compassionate intelligence, and her indefatigable wit, inspired and stimulated our entire community. As a citizen, Wendy epitomized an ideal of liberal values: generous, open-minded, caring, loyal, she proved a tireless, articulate, charismatic champion for artist, women, educators, children, and many many others. But it was as a friend, daughter, sister, and mother that the gift of Wendy's warmth and light burned brightest. We are blessed to have known her, and grieve to lose her.

The Trustees, staff and volunteers of Educational Broadcasting Corporation, licensee of Thirteen/WNET and WLIW, join the New York City artistic community and all America in mourning the loss of Wendy Wasserstein. She was a brilliant playwright, a passionate advocate of the arts, and a wonderful human being. With her award-winning dramas, she brought uncommon spark to the American stage. Her unforgettable screenplays invited television and movie audiences to sojourn with strong characters, fascinating plots and excellent writing full of wit and intelligence. Her work with the Open Doors mentoring program in theater attests to her devotion to education and her belief in the importance of using the arts to inspire young people. A lifelong friend of public television, Wendy was an active member of the Educational Broadcasting Corporation's Board of Trustees, devoting unending energy to the presence of public television in our lives. As chairman of the Board's programming committee, she generously shared her wisdom, insight and wealth of ideas to help us create exciting new public television offerings with a special emphasis on strengthening the arts on television. Wendy often spoke publicly about the great influence public broadcasting had on her life. But it could not have been nearly as profound as the influence she had on us. We will miss her.

The program for students was born out of Wendy's conviction that it was the birthright of every child in NYC to have access to the theatre. Through her tireless efforts on the program's behalf, it has grown from one group mentored by her, to 17 groups of NYC high school students mentored by 17 theater professionals. Each group has Wendy's spirit--the spirit of inquiry, curiousity, discussion, love of children and love of the theatre. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family and her many colleagues.
