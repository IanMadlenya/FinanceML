transported by helicopter to a burial site, Iraqi and American officials discussed the intrigue, maneuvering and confusion that preceded the decision to rush Mr. Hussein to the gallows, in ways that required Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to override constitutional, legal and religious precepts that seemed to give Mr. Hussein the prospect of a more orderly and dignified end. A1 The list of American military fatalities in Iraq has reached the milestone of 3,000 deaths since the March 2003 invasion. The number reflects how much more dangerous a soldier's job in Iraq has become in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency. Violence in the country is at a high, according to the Pentagon. A1 Confronted with a second, unofficial, and more graphic video account of the execution of Saddam Hussein, executives at television news organizations made a series of what one executive called ''delicate editorial decisions'' about what they would put on the air to augment the first pictures of the execution. A7 U.N. Successor's Home Delayed When Ban Ki-moon takes over as secretary general of the United Nations, he may quickly have to grapple with the crisis in Darfur, fighting in Somalia and the continuing strife in the Middle East.

A6 NATIONAL A8-16 Democrats to Propose New Ethics Rules The Democrats taking over Congress are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws, pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rule. So far, however, their proposals are not as comprehensive as changes already adopted by many state legislatures. A1 River Restoration Effort In one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West, water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a nearly century-long dry spell. That part of the river had been left mostly drained when upstream water, fed by snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada, was channeled 233 miles to Los Angeles. A1 Overcrowding in Madison Madison, Wis., a college town that sought to reverse the decline of its downtown in the 1980s and 90s to draw people at night and on weekends, is now facing overcrowding on the streets, vandalism and, most significantly, the police say, alcohol-related crime. Officials are now grappling with how to scale down downtown. A15 Higher Pay Sought for Judiciary Chief Justice John G.

B1 Snowless December a Rarity The National Weather Service said that last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake in Central Park since Rutherford B. Hayes was president. B2 Park Project Nearly Done Calvert Vaux's original plans for Central Park called for a split-level terrace overlooking the lake. The more than 15,000 ornate tiles on the terrace's 50-ton ceiling deteriorated over the decades, but a $7 million restoration is expected to be completed soon.

Countless other start-ups rely on Google as their primary driver of traffic or on Google's powerful advertising system as their primary source of income. [C1.] DO-IT-YOURSELF SEARCH ENGINE -- The voluntary collaborative ''wiki'' model, which was marshaled to create the behemoth online encyclopedia Wikipedia, is being recruited to build a better search engine. [C5.] STRUGGLES FOR SATELLITE RADIO -- Last year's debut of Howard Stern's radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio put the technology on the map.

[C4.] BEST-LAID PLANS GO AWRY -- The Wall Street Journal is introducing its new design -- and smaller size -- tomorrow.

[C4.] GIFT LAPTOPS STIR CRITICISM -- In an effort to reach out to bloggers, Microsoft recently gave away some expensive laptops loaded with a new software system.
