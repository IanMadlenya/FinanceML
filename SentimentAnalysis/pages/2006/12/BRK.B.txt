A3-7 Hussein's Final Journey Amid a Flurry of Questions As Saddam Hussein's body was transported by helicopter to a burial site, Iraqi and American officials discussed the intrigue, maneuvering and confusion that preceded the decision to rush Mr. Hussein to the gallows, in ways that required Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to override constitutional, legal and religious precepts that seemed to give Mr. Hussein the prospect of a more orderly and dignified end. A1 The list of American military fatalities in Iraq has reached the milestone of 3,000 deaths since the March 2003 invasion. The number reflects how much more dangerous a soldier's job in Iraq has become in the face of a growing and increasingly sophisticated insurgency. Violence in the country is at a high, according to the Pentagon. A1 Confronted with a second, unofficial, and more graphic video account of the execution of Saddam Hussein, executives at television news organizations made a series of what one executive called ''delicate editorial decisions'' about what they would put on the air to augment the first pictures of the execution. A7 U.N. Successor's Home Delayed When Ban Ki-moon takes over as secretary general of the United Nations, he may quickly have to grapple with the crisis in Darfur, fighting in Somalia and the continuing strife in the Middle East. But he will have to wait to enjoy the secretary general's official residence in Sutton Place, which is being renovated. A5 Nuclear Debate on Iran Radio An Iranian radio program Goftegoo Radio, on a government-run station has been conducting an open debate about whether Iran should change its tough stance on its nuclear program. Its fiery discussions may be setting new boundaries for discussion about one of the most important issues in Iran. A4 Tighter Grip on Venezuela Press President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela's decision not to renew the broadcast license of RCTV, one of the country's oldest television stations and a frequent critic of his government, has fueled a fierce debate over whether he is stifling dissent in Venezuela as he strengthens his control of the broadcasting industry. A4 2 Die, Many Injured in Thailand At least six small bombs exploded around Bangkok, killing two people and wounding more than 20 in a city that remains under martial law after a coup. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Moments later, two more bombs went off near a downtown mall, wounding eight people, including six foreigners. A3 Israeli Closer to Freedom Palestinian groups involved in holding an Israeli soldier who was captured in late June said that significant progress had been made toward the release of Cpl. Gilad Shalit, captured by Hamas and two other militant groups in a raid into Israel on June 25. A6 NATIONAL A8-16 Democrats to Propose New Ethics Rules The Democrats taking over Congress are promising sweeping changes to ethics and lobbying laws, pledging to clean up after a spate of corruption scandals under Republican rule. So far, however, their proposals are not as comprehensive as changes already adopted by many state legislatures. A1 River Restoration Effort In one of the largest river restoration efforts in the West, water is again flowing along a 62-mile stretch of the Owens River after a nearly century-long dry spell. That part of the river had been left mostly drained when upstream water, fed by snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada, was channeled 233 miles to Los Angeles. A1 Overcrowding in Madison Madison, Wis., a college town that sought to reverse the decline of its downtown in the 1980s and 90s to draw people at night and on weekends, is now facing overcrowding on the streets, vandalism and, most significantly, the police say, alcohol-related crime. Officials are now grappling with how to scale down downtown. A15 Higher Pay Sought for Judiciary Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. made judicial pay the sole topic of his second annual report, declaring that the failure by Congress to raise federal judges' salaries in recent years has become a ''constitutional crisis'' that puts the future of the federal courts in jeopardy. A14 Thousands Honor Ford Thousands of mourners filed past the coffin of former President Gerald R. Ford as he lay in state below the Capitol dome, many saying they came to pay overdue respect to an overshadowed leader. A15 Climate Scientists Speak Out Amid the shouting lately about whether global warming is a human-caused catastrophe or a hoax, some climate scientists in the usually invisible middle are speaking up. A16 Search for Stranded Travelers Small planes canvassed snow-covered roads in Colorado, searching for stranded travelers after a powerful winter storm piled drifts up to 10 feet high across much of the Plains. A16 OBITUARIES B7 Craig Hugh Smyth An art historian who drew attention to the importance of conservation and the recovery of purloined art and cultural objects, he was 91. B7 Johnny Gibson A former world-record holder in the 400-meter hurdles and successful track coach at Seton Hall University for 26 years, he was 101. B7 Dennis Linde An influential country songwriter who composed Elvis Presley's 1972 hit ''Burning Love'' and the Dixie Chicks' mordantly humorous anthem ''Goodbye Earl,'' he was 63. B7 NEW YORK/REGION B1-6 Spitzer's Term Begins As Scandals Engulf Capital Eliot Spitzer was sworn in as New York's 54th governor, after making ethics reform a central pledge of the landslide victory in his election campaign and watching in recent weeks as scandal reached the upper reaches of state government. A1 Murder Up, Other Crimes Down The New York City police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, called it a good year, after rapes, robberies and assaults continued to decline, and major crime over all fell by 5 percent from the previous year. B1 Snowless December a Rarity The National Weather Service said that last month appeared to be the first December without a snowflake in Central Park since Rutherford B. Hayes was president. B2 Park Project Nearly Done Calvert Vaux's original plans for Central Park called for a split-level terrace overlooking the lake. The more than 15,000 ornate tiles on the terrace's 50-ton ceiling deteriorated over the decades, but a $7 million restoration is expected to be completed soon. B1 Neediest Cases B6 BUSINESS DAY C1-6 Search for the Next Google Even as Google continues to outmaneuver its main search engine rivals, Yahoo and Microsoft, plenty of newcomers are trying to beat the company at its own game. But countless start-ups in Silicon Valley also rely on Google as their primary source of income. C1 Control of Disney Online Robert A. Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, will soon announce a new disney.com Web site. But beyond the redesign, a pressing issue faces Mr. Iger. Who within Disney should be running the company's Internet properties? C1 Struggle for Satellite Radio Last year's debut of Howard Stern's show on Sirius Satellite Radio may have put the technology on the map, but Sirius and its larger rival, XM Satellite Radio, have continued to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, and now the two services may be considering a merger. C1 DVDs Face Crack in Security An anonymous computer programmer may have skewed the competition between HD-DVD and Blu-ray, rival standards for high-definition DVD discs, by announcing on an Internet discussion forum that he has defeated a scheme that both use to protect digital content. C1 Business Digest C2 ARTS E1-22 Met Opera's Theatrical Debut A recent live broadcast, in high definition, of Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' to movie theaters across the United States was the first of six productions to be broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera through April. E1 Girding for Legal Battle In Hollywood battles, a war of words often precedes legal formalities.

They designed it as a split-level terrace overlooking the park's lake, with an underground arcade whose ceiling was composed of almost 16,000 tiles. Over the decades, the 50-ton ceiling weakened and its tiles deteriorated. The tiles have been in storage since being removed in the 1980s during an initial repair effort. The Central Park Conservancy renewed its plan for a $7 million restoration after getting a $3.5 million gift from the estate of Evelyn West in 2002. The arcade, originally completed in the 1860s, is expected to reopen in late January. HAEYOUN PARK AND GRAHAM ROBERTS Tile Restoration CLEANING AND REPAIRING Conservators have spent the last two years cleaning all 15,876 tiles, reattaching broken segments and repainting the tiles to match their original colors. REPLACING DAMAGE About 10 percent of the tiles were beyond repair. New ones were made in Stokeon-Trent, England, for $250 to $270 each. REINSTALLING TILE PANELS The 49 panels alternate between two patterns. Three panels, consisting only of brand new tiles, will be placed in one of the two side loggias. New Layers Of Support UPPER TERRACE A new waterproof membrane will catch water leaking through the pavement and redirect it to a subsurface drain before it reaches the ceiling tiles. STEEL SUPPORTS Brick arches have been replaced by steel beams, which, together with the existing wrought iron girders, will act as the primary support for the road above. CAST IRON RIBS The ornamental cast iron framework was painted a shade of gold with mica powder for extra sheen, accented by blue and reddish brown. Not much is known about the framework's historic colors other than that they were ''richly gilded.'' TILE PANELS Tiles on each panel are fused with mortar, then screwed into a metal frame so they can be installed into the cast iron ribs as a single unit. Each panel has 324 encaustic, or inlaid, tiles. They were made using small pieces of colored clay laid into a mold and baked together so that the colors are embedded, not just a surface glaze. Diagrams highlight the aforementioned items.
