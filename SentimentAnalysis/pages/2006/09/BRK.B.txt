I don't mean that literally, but metaphorically. It's time for George Bush to do what Richard Nixon did - perform an act whose effectiveness is a function of the fact that he is the last man anyone would have expected to do it. What would that act be? It won't be - and shouldn't be - agreeing to a face-to-face, one-on-one debate with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, if only because when you accept the other guy's invitation you cede him the initiative and the position of leadership, and we all know that George Bush will never willingly do that. No, it has to be something that a) makes clear that he is the one in charge, and b) is so surprising and (apparently) out of character that its very announcement alters the geopolitical landscape and disarms criticism in advance.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "\u2018Schr\u00f6dinger's Ball\u2019", "content_kicker": "First Chapter"}, "snippet": "\u201cThe President of Montana slumps low behind his desk and waits for the gunshots to stop.\u201d", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "\u201cThe President of Montana slumps low behind his desk and waits for the gunshots to stop.\u201d", "keywords": [{"value": "Books and Literature", "is_major": "N", "rank": "1", "name": "subject"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "\u2018Welcome to the Homeland\u2019", "content_kicker": "First Chapter"}, "snippet": "\u201cFor blue state types this is enemy territory . . .
