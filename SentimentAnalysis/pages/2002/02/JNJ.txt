Museums * ''BAMANA: THE ART OF EXISTENCE IN MALI,'' Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through May 19). African art is about envisioning a moral universe and shaping the world through spiritual energy to conform to that vision. The positive effects are evident in objects and images that unite communities, ease pain, forecast the future and explain the past. Nearly 100 of them are included in this wonderful show by one of the best museums in town. Among the highlights are exquisite iron ritual staffs, personable hand puppets, grave carved-wood maternity figures and a whole herd of the infinitely stylish, antelope-shaped crest masks known as Ci-wara. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+; free on Sundays (Holland Cotter).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "S.& P. and Nasdaq Dropped for Month, but Dow Gained", "kicker": "THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS"}, "snippet": "Stocks fell yesterday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its biggest monthly drop since September, on concern corporate profits would rebound more slowly than expected.
