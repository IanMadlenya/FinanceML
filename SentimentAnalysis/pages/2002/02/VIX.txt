Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 14. Now Playing ''A BEAUTIFUL MIND,'' starring Russell Crowe, Ed Harris and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Ron Howard (PG-13, 129 minutes). In transforming the life of the brilliant mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. into a muzzy, triumph-of-the-human-spirit Hollywood movie, Mr. Howard and his collaborators have stripped it of anything that might present the audience with the slightest discomfort or reason to think about the documented facts concerning Mr. Nash. On its own terms, though, the movie succeeds in dramatizing Mr. Nash's mental illness and to a lesser extent his mathematical insights. Mr. Crowe's performance is honest and focused, but the movie's conceptions of intellectual life and human character are ultimately so simplistic, so deeply mistrustful of the audience's intelligence, that any chance for genuine insight is squandered (A. O. Scott).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "S.& P. and Nasdaq Dropped for Month, but Dow Gained", "kicker": "THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS"}, "snippet": "Stocks fell yesterday, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its biggest monthly drop since September, on concern corporate profits would rebound more slowly than expected.

ALIEN ANT FARM; ADEMA, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Alien Ant Farm is best known as the band that broke through with a hard-rock rendition of Michael Jackson's ''Smooth Criminal,'' but its own songs are nearly as catchy. On its major-label debut, ''ANThology'' (DreamWorks), it finds a way to make quirky music from chugging guitars and cheerful hooks. The opening act, Adema, is a generic loud rock band whose lead singer is the half-brother of the lead singer of Korn. If the group did not exist, it could be invented as a brilliant parody of the rock industry. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $18 (Kelefa Sanneh).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Enron Paid Huge Bonuses in '01; Experts See a Motive for Cheating", "kicker": "ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION"}, "snippet": "The Enron Corporation paid its executives huge one-time bonuses last year as a reward for hitting a series of stock-price targets ending in 2000 -- the very time, investigators now say, when corporate officials were improperly inflating the company's...", "abstract": "Enron Corp paid executives huge one-time bonuses in 2001 as reward for hitting series of stock-price targets in 2000, even as corporate officials allegedly were improperly inflating company's profits by as much as billion dollars; company records show bonus payments and other special cash distributions of $320 million were paid just 10 months before company's collapse into bankruptcy; legal experts say payments could provide strong evidence of motive for financial machinations that investigators think distorted company's reported performance and led to its demise; details of bonuses and of other payments totaling $432 million made to 2,000 corporate executives during two years prior to Enron's collapse are described in spreadsheets and data on corporate computers that have been obtained by federal prosecutors; huge one-time payments were made under program known as Performance Unit Plan; almost every decision that ultimately led to company's collapse was made during time frame of that program; photo; chart (M)", "lead_paragraph": "The Enron Corporation paid its executives huge one-time bonuses last year as a reward for hitting a series of stock-price targets ending in 2000 -- the very time, investigators now say, when corporate officials were improperly inflating the company's profits by as much as a billion dollars.
