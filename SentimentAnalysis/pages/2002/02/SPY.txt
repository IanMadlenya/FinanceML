Peter Sheridan's gentle, misty-eyed screen adaptation of Behan's coming-of-age novel, ''Borstal Boy,'' barely hints at the marathon toper to come in a scene in which the teenage Brendan gets pleasantly tipsy on cider. The film, set in the early 1940's, is a likable rites-of-passage memory piece doused in period nostalgia, including the prominent use of vintage Movietone newsreels to mark the events of World War II. While incarcerated in a Borstal (a British reform school), the teenage Brendan discovered the theater by reading Oscar Wilde, stood up to the institution's resident bully, tried and failed to escape, and formed two romantic relationships.

A soldier is carried on a stretcher toward medical personnel who are calmly preparing to attend to his injuries. But the operating table, the gowned and masked nurses and surgeon, the stretcher carrier are all standing in water, and the operating room is enclosed in a mosquito-netting tent in the middle of a mangrove swamp. A nurse draws aside the flap of the tent, whose fluttery lines complement the delicate hanging tendrils and other vegetation. Natural light illuminates the table and hits the swirls of water around the approaching medic. In haunting unreality and beauty, this picture surpasses Robert Capa's 1943 image of British surgeons working shirtless in a church in Sicily. Unlike Capa, who is internationally famous, Vo Anh Khanh is not much known even in his own country, Vietnam.
