If the president is serious about this issue, he will need to lean on recalcitrant House Republicans, the chief impediment to reform, to pass a bill elevating mental health coverage to a par with medical and surgical coverage. Congress took the first step toward this goal in 1996 when it passed legislation that prevented private plans that offer mental health coverage from setting annual or lifetime limits that are lower than those set for other illnesses. But that law left a loophole that allowed companies to require much higher deductibles and co-payments for mental health treatments than for other diseases. So a new bill -- pioneered by Senators Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota -- is now pending that would require parity in all terms, including deductibles, co-insurance and duration of treatment.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "UNITED STATES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HEALTH INSURANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MENTAL HEALTH AND DISORDERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEDICINE AND HEALTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAW AND LEGISLATION"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Top Executive at ABC Television Leaves After One Year in the Job", "kicker": "THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING"}, "snippet": "After what numerous executives described as a long period of uncertainty and even dysfunction at the highest management level of ABC, the network announced yesterday that Steven M.
