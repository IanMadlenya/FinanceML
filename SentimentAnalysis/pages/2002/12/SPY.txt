Reinhardt, who died 50 years ago, is now legendary. Mr. Vignola is now a guitarist in his mid-30's. Stephen Holden of The New York Times calls him virtuosic. Legend and virtuosity come together on Jan. 8 and 9 at Sweet Rhythm (formerly Sweet Basil) in Greenwich Village, where Mr. Vignola will lead his quintet, Hot Club USAC in a celebration of Reinhardt and his equally famous jazz violinist, Stephane Grappelli. Performances are at 8 and 10 p.m. in the club, at 88 Seventh Avenue South, between Grove and Bleecker Streets. In the Mood Can't go to Vienna for the New Year's Day festivities?

The Side Hunt faded, but the vision of the 27 pioneer bird counters led forth by Frank Chapman, an impresario of an ornithologist, has persevered unto a third generation. The current annual Christmas bird census involves a record-breaking 55,000 -- count 'em -- human participants. They are out across the nation and hemisphere bagging more than 50 million birds by eyeball. Anyone who has quietly watched these volunteer watchers must admire them as models of human unobtrusiveness. The personal joy they experience from patiently spotting and jotting down each flitting fellow creature, exotic or not, is balanced by a strong pragmatic factor in the management of the census by the National Audubon Society. This year, the three-week count, which ends Sunday, has an extra sharp eye out for regional declines in crows, jays, owls and other raptors -- birds considered especially susceptible to the West Nile virus that can afflict humans. The falloff in songbird populations and woodpeckers also remains an annual concern. The steady drop in wild turkeys in the counts of the 1930's sparked moves to protect that bird.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "HUNTING AND TRAPPING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EDITORIALS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIRDS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Tough Opera For Tough Times", "kicker": "CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK"}, "snippet": "Facing a sinking economy, opera companies and orchestras large and small across the United States report severe deficits and are starting to panic.
