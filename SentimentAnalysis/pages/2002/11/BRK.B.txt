The man who had run the magazine since it was founded six years before, who had used it to define and propagate a new aesthetic so thoroughly branded that it was known only by the magazine's name, was stepping down. It was the end of an era. Or to put it more precisely, it was the end of a vanishingly brief moment in consumer history. But through the combination of the style world's insular obsession with trends and the magazine's own self-mythologization, that brief moment had come to seem, to Wallpaper's devoted readers, like the dawning of a new age in design. The look of the magazine, the tone of its articles, the subjects of its fascination and the precision of its demographic target had all been perfectly in tune with the cultural mood of the times.
