He rides his motorcycle in them, commuting from his place in Williamsburg to work in SoHo. He eats his Subway lunch on them. He works in them, loafs in them, D.J.'s in them. And he washes them, in cold water by hand, but only twice. ''They are really gross,'' he says. ''But that is the whole idea -- I wanted them to be completely natural.'' He knows the biography of every tear, from the tattered hem of the leg (''that's from slipping off the kick-start of my bike'') to the shredded back pocket (where the zipper of his wallet cut it up) to the imprint of his favorite pen. Then, in August, Sun Choe, a Levi's designer from San Francisco, comes by the company's Selvedge store on Mulberry Street, where Troy works. Choe likes the look of the grimy life contained in Troy's jeans so much that she wants to make a copy of them, distressed in exactly the same way that his jeans are -- with identical 3-D ''whisker'' folds below the front pockets, fades along the thighs and that shredded back pocket. As a designer in an industry dealing with the same material and same basic shape for the past 130 years, Choe's options for innovation are left largely to the realm of ''character.'' Troy resists her request -- his jeans are his uniform, his second skin, and he has no intention of turning them into a rough draft for Levi's next line. ''It was weird,'' he says. ''They wanted to duplicate my hard work and take all these shortcuts on a year's worth of my life.'' But a week later, Troy caves and sends them in. ''I guess I thought it would be funny to see a stack of my jeans in a store,'' he says. He never even asked to be paid for them. ''I don't really think that way,'' he says.
