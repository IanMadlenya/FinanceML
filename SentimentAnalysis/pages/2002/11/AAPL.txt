The rest of us got what we got and generally liked it -- a toaster was a toaster; blue jeans came one way; and if we got to choose the color of our car, well, we felt pretty good about it. Today's objects are not necessarily any better designed (it's hard to beat a Corvette -- or a paper napkin, for that matter), but their design is more conspicuous: we have never been more aware of the power of the package. When we look at an Apple iPod, we know that a huge part of its appeal is its sleek design, a draw so powerful it is almost as if the company invented digitalized music. Several years ago, Volkswagen realized that its potency as a brand had a lot to do with the ghost of its oddly endearing Beetle. It brought the car back from the dead, smartly freshened its look and a new era for the car company was born. The Gap changed American fashion by showing us the simple sense of a T-shirt, Michael Graves (and a brilliant ad campaign) lifted Target ever upward and Martha Stewart's stuff still sells at Kmart, even as Stewart herself has become a tabloid punching bag.

It wasn't the discussions of $500 dominos, personal submarines or ''two-roomed goldfish bowls.'' It was the editor's letter. Written, as always, by Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, it ended on an uncharacteristically melancholy note: ''As for me, gentle readers, little more to say than thank you and adieu.'' The man who had run the magazine since it was founded six years before, who had used it to define and propagate a new aesthetic so thoroughly branded that it was known only by the magazine's name, was stepping down. It was the end of an era. Or to put it more precisely, it was the end of a vanishingly brief moment in consumer history. But through the combination of the style world's insular obsession with trends and the magazine's own self-mythologization, that brief moment had come to seem, to Wallpaper's devoted readers, like the dawning of a new age in design. The look of the magazine, the tone of its articles, the subjects of its fascination and the precision of its demographic target had all been perfectly in tune with the cultural mood of the times. Without Br\u00fbl\u00e9, supporters and detractors alike wondered, could the magazine survive?

The annals of New York will also show that you were among the handful of leaders who prevented our beloved city from sliding into the abyss of bankruptcy during the 1970's and, as founder Program Planners, Inc., you became one of the most respected experts in municipal finance in the nation.
