The rest of us got what we got and generally liked it -- a toaster was a toaster; blue jeans came one way; and if we got to choose the color of our car, well, we felt pretty good about it. Today's objects are not necessarily any better designed (it's hard to beat a Corvette -- or a paper napkin, for that matter), but their design is more conspicuous: we have never been more aware of the power of the package. When we look at an Apple iPod, we know that a huge part of its appeal is its sleek design, a draw so powerful it is almost as if the company invented digitalized music. Several years ago, Volkswagen realized that its potency as a brand had a lot to do with the ghost of its oddly endearing Beetle. It brought the car back from the dead, smartly freshened its look and a new era for the car company was born. The Gap changed American fashion by showing us the simple sense of a T-shirt, Michael Graves (and a brilliant ad campaign) lifted Target ever upward and Martha Stewart's stuff still sells at Kmart, even as Stewart herself has become a tabloid punching bag.
