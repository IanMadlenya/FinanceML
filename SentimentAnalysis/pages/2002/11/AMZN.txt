It wasn't the discussions of $500 dominos, personal submarines or ''two-roomed goldfish bowls.'' It was the editor's letter. Written, as always, by Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9, it ended on an uncharacteristically melancholy note: ''As for me, gentle readers, little more to say than thank you and adieu.'' The man who had run the magazine since it was founded six years before, who had used it to define and propagate a new aesthetic so thoroughly branded that it was known only by the magazine's name, was stepping down. It was the end of an era. Or to put it more precisely, it was the end of a vanishingly brief moment in consumer history. But through the combination of the style world's insular obsession with trends and the magazine's own self-mythologization, that brief moment had come to seem, to Wallpaper's devoted readers, like the dawning of a new age in design. The look of the magazine, the tone of its articles, the subjects of its fascination and the precision of its demographic target had all been perfectly in tune with the cultural mood of the times. Without Br\u00fbl\u00e9, supporters and detractors alike wondered, could the magazine survive? More important, could those times?", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BRULE, TYLER"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "WALLPAPER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MAGAZINES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "A Man's Passion For the Big Rigs Is on Display"}, "snippet": "THE story behind the Golden Age of Trucking Museum in Middlebury is, appropriately enough, the story of a lot of long drives.

History will record your role as a revered New York labor leader who fought for the working man and woman, a man whose principles and ethics stood as a rock against a turbulent time when the very dignity of labor was under assault. The annals of New York will also show that you were among the handful of leaders who prevented our beloved city from sliding into the abyss of bankruptcy during the 1970's and, as founder Program Planners, Inc., you became one of the most respected experts in municipal finance in the nation. You leave a behind a family that grieves for a life that has ended but enormously proud of the living legacy that you left us and all New Yorkers. BIGEL-Jack. The Board of Directors, officers and staff of GHI deeply mourn the passing of Jack Bigel. He had an extraordinary ability to bring people together in pursuit of the common good.

It was a great color while it lasted, a cross between butternut squash and a Post-it note. But come December, it will be put down like apricot and lilac before it. Fiestaware hasn't changed the design of its hallmark Art Deco china in 66 years, but Homer Laughlin China Company, which puts out Fiestaware, banks the brand on a strategic rollout of new hues. Each time Fiestaware discontinues one or adds another to its current 11-color line, some collectors frantically bid on eBay for plates in a discontinued shade while others scramble to be the first to buy place settings in the latest. In June at the Gourmet Products Show in San Francisco, it was announced that shamrock would be the new thing. By November, more than 1,000 place settings in the yellowish English-pea-green glaze had been presold on Amazon.com -- months before the china will be available to the public. If it seems improbable that plates, salad bowls, salt shakers and coffee creamers can inspire frenzy, consider this: Fiestaware is the most collected brand of china in the United States. It's also the No. 1 selection for casual dinnerware in American bridal registries. And it's only becoming more popular, because most engaged couples these days eschew fine china, which is hard to care for. (Many patterns have gold-leaf details so delicate that the china can't be put in the dishwasher.) Besides, not many young people trot out their bone china when entertaining friends. Fiestaware epitomizes the concept of ''everyday china.'' It manages to be utilitarian and fun, but unlike the plates at stores like Crate & Barrel and Pier One Imports, it has a tradition.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "LAUGHLIN, HOMER, CHINA CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TABLEWARE"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Small Brown Trout In Bright New World", "kicker": "OUTDOORS"}, "snippet": "Five small brown trout, the biggest of them nine inches long, don't usually make for a spectacular afternoon of fishing.
