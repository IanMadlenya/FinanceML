The sneakers come compliments of Nike, whose footwear is prominently placed in the 15-year-old rapper's feature film, ''Like Mike,'' a sort of cross-pollination of ''Hoop Dreams'' and ''Harry Potter'': a scrappy orphan is supernaturally transformed into an N.B.A. star when he puts on a pair of old high-tops with the initials M.J. Today is the last day of production, and Lil' Bow Wow, accompanied by a driver, his bodyguard and one of his managers, is heading toward the Great Western Forum to film a final basketball scene with Vince Carter, the star shooting guard for the Toronto Raptors and, as it happens, a friend of his. Bow, as those in his circle call him, is an avid N.B.A. fan, and at barely over five feet tall, an impressive player; the slam dunks and 30-foot jump shots he executes in ''Like Mike'' may be digitally enhanced, but the rest is all him. Still, 20th Century Fox is not placing a large Fourth of July weekend bet on him simply because he can dribble with his knees. This raspy-voiced rapper from Columbus, Ohio, has established himself as the leader of what might be called youngsta rap, a PG version of the NC-17 gangsta rap with a similar brand of braggadocio, only about teenage crushes instead of booty calls. Under the creative guidance of Jermaine Dupri, a producer and rapper, Lil' Bow Wow has made two albums -- ''Beware of Dog'' in 2000 and ''Doggy Bag'' last year -- that together have sold more than four million copies, all without a single profanity uttered. He is listed in the Guinness World Records book as the youngest solo rap artist ever to score a No.1 hit, with the party anthem ''Bounce With Me,'' released when he was 13.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CALDWELL, TERESA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "LIL' BOW WOW"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSIC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RAP MUSIC"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Data Bank; Shares Absorb a New Shock to the System"}, "snippet": "Despite revelations of accounting problems at both WorldCom and Xerox, parts of the stock market managed to get through the week little changed, while the Nasdaq posted a tidy gain on bargain-hunting.
