Passing a Starbucks and peering through the plate-glass window at patrons mesmerized by a cup of strong coffee and a newspaper, the person next to them or nothing at all, it seems possible, at least for a fanciful moment, that you would. Coffee bars are the last refuge of conspicuous consumption. Designer labels are no longer chic, except among rap stars and tourists. Modesty is in. But the $3.75 grande latte at Starbucks is a permissible indulgence. Addictive, nonhallucinogenic and perfectly legal. Now comes the news that coffee growers in Central America, Africa and Asia are starving. Americans pay an average of $3.60 a pound for supermarket brand coffee, and the farmers earn a mere 24 cents a pound for their beans. I feel guilty. I think about those magazine ads that picture innocent children in threadbare clothes whose lives can be changed for just pennies a month. But then I remember my reaction to those ads.
