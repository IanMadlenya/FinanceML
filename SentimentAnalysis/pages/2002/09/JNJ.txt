He has confidence in all 10 pitchers on the roster, including Jeff Weaver, the starter-turned-long-reliever who could be called on early if a starter does not seem sharp. Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez could be used in the same role, essentially giving the Yankees two backup starting pitchers if something goes wrong right away. But the starters have been at their best in September, and in seven games against the Angels this season, the Yankees' starter made it to the seventh inning in all but one game. Mike Mussina and Roger Clemens did not face Anaheim this season, but Mussina has been the Yankees' best pitcher since late August and Clemens has beaten the Angels more than any other team in his career. Torre says he does not want to use closer Mariano Rivera before the ninth inning, and with Ramiro Mendoza, Mike Stanton and Steve Karsay, he may not have to. But Karsay has struggled against the Angels' hitters (Garret Anderson, Tim Salmon, Troy Glaus and Darin Erstad are a combined 20 for 48 off him), and while Stanton has handled Erstad and Scott Spiezio (4 for 28 combined), Anderson is a career .375 hitter off him.
