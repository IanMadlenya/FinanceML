Nothing is new, of course, about the idea that in a so-called knowledge economy, a company's success depends greatly on the collective skills of its employees -- its human capital. Companies that invest more in developing that capital should fare better. For many years, however, investors had a big question about that investment theory: How can it be put into practice? Until recently, it was next to impossible to rank companies according to how much they spent on employee training and education. After all, companies typically do not report such expenditures on a separate line on their income statements, and annual reports and public pronouncements aren't much help, either, because they may pay only lip service to the notion that employees are the most important asset of a business.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "LABOR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CORPORATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STOCKS AND BONDS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Where's Marv Throneberry?"}, "snippet": "THE NEW BILL JAMES HISTORICAL BASEBALL ABSTRACT   By Bill James.

Fortunately, the couple did not take the school at its word. Testing by a learning specialist revealed that the child was brighter than most. He suffered from a common neurological quirk that makes it difficult for him to process written language. Nine in 10 children with this problem can succeed if given teachers who are properly trained. The problem is that fewer than a quarter of America's teachers know how to teach reading to children who do not get it automatically. Children forced to repeat classes with ineffective instruction tend to fall behind and act out, then drop out. Learning disabilities will be diagnosed in thousands of children this year in New York City. Federal law requires that these children receive extra help, but such help is often offered by teachers who lack the skills to make a difference. More than 1,200 New York City families who know about the law will attempt to place their children in private schools for the learning-disabled -- and will petition the city for the cost of school tuition. The federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act allows families to follow that course once public schools have failed to provide an effective education for a disabled child.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "EDUCATION AND SCHOOLS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "READING AND WRITING SKILLS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "INVESTING WITH/Forbes L.

By naming Denzel Washington best actor for ''Training Day'' and Halle Berry best actress for ''Monster's Ball,'' the 74th annual Oscars made news, and made history, as few of their predecessors have. Early in the night, Sidney Poitier's award for lifetime achievement looked like the academy's way of hedging its bets, in case none of the three African-American acting nominees (Will Smith was nominated for ''Ali'') emerged victorious. A few hours later, his presence seemed prophetic, as if a screenwriter had deftly foreshadowed in the first act what would happen in the third.
