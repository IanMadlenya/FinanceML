There are plenty of good candidates, but fewer than in years past. As more magazines default to a visual rather than literary palette, the 4,000-word article has become a relic, first replaced by the 800-word quick take and then further boiled to a 400-word blurb that is little more than a long caption. In most magazines on today's newsstands, words are increasingly beside the point, mere graphic elements that are generally used to frame pictures. Magazine buyers have always been divided into readers and lookers. But consumers who actually open a magazine at the front and commence reading are becoming an increasingly rarefied demographic group. In a medium that has atomized into niche after niche, the long-form narrative may become just one more fetish, no more or less worthy of a magazine than Sub-Zero refrigerators or B-list starlets.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "MAGAZINES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Son Is Charged in Beating Of New Hampshire Judge"}, "snippet": "The son of a State Supreme Court justice was charged early today in an attack on his father that caused facial fractures so severe that they required six hours of surgery to repair.
