One byproduct has been a significant shift in the balance of power for buyers and sellers in the technology sector. In the bygone era of a few years ago, when established companies in every industry were said to be threatened with extinction by an upstart dot-com, computer hardware and software was bought with abandon, motivated by fear and fashion. Many corporate executives have a lingering sense of being duped a bit by the grand promises of the industry's ''visionaries,'' who, after the party, look more like mere salesmen.", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTER SOFTWARE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Leiter's Pitching Is Only Part of the Story", "kicker": "BASEBALL"}, "snippet": "Al Leiter was standing in front of his apartment on the Upper East Side on Saturday evening, discussing his life as Mets ace, mentor to the pitching staff, aspiring politician and ambassador for New York City.
