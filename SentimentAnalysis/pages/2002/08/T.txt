Most families wait for their ''Paideia'' to arrive at school; but serious devotees know when the advance audio version of ''Paideia'' will go up on the Scripps Howard Web site. On that day each year, the Goldsteins of West Hempstead, N.Y. -- Amy, Ari, J.J. and Amanda, along with their parents, Jonathan and Mona -- assemble like the Von Trapps in a thunderstorm. The whole family squeezes into Amy's bedroom and fires up the computer, and the familiar, baronial voice of the National Spelling Bee pronouncer, Alex J. Cameron, carefully enunciates each new addition to the list -- aition, campanile, kittel, giaour. Each Goldstein sits with pen and paper in hand, as still and focused as a game-show contestant, and spells the words, one by one. It takes hours. It is the equivalent, for this family, of the first scrimmage of the year. It signals the beginning of bee season, a long nationwide winnowing process that starts with the 10 million kids who enter class bees in December, passes through countless district and regional bees in the spring and concludes at the National Spelling Bee in late May, leaving a lone speller standing on a stage, holding a jug-handled trophy in clammy hands. Of all the rituals the Goldsteins observe -- and as Orthodox Jews, they observe many -- this is one of the most important and perhaps the most personal. It is a reminder of what binds them, and defines them, as a family.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, AMY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, JJ"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, ARI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, JONATHAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, AMANDA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, MONA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NATIONAL SPELLING BEE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPELLING"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Tennis Babes In, Peacocks Out", "kicker": "NOTICED"}, "snippet": "IN Nike's current advertising, a top-ranking tennis player, James Blake, 22, peels off a white shirt to show a spectacular set of deltoids and pecs.

The Bush administration's definition of the challenge that America confronts has been cast largely in semireligious terms. The public has been told repeatedly that terrorism is ''evil,'' which it undoubtedly is, and that ''evildoers'' are responsible for it, which doubtless they are. But beyond these justifiable condemnations, there is a historical void. It is as if terrorism is suspended in outer space as an abstract phenomenon, with ruthless terrorists acting under some Satanic inspiration unrelated to any specific motivation. President Bush has wisely eschewed identifying terrorism with Islam as a whole and been careful to stress that Islam as such is not at fault. But some supporters of the administration have been less careful about such distinctions, arguing that Islamic culture in general is so hostile to the West, and especially to democracy, that it has created a fertile soil for terrorist hatred of America.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "ISRAEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Memories Were Made Of This?", "kicker": "THEATER"}, "snippet": "IN hard times, it is said that lightweight, even mindless, entertainment thrives.
