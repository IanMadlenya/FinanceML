Then disaster struck: Eakins contracted malaria. He spent two months burning with fever and nearly died. When he was finally well enough to paint again, in January 1874, he composed an extraordinary body of work based on his visit to the area, including two seminal oil paintings, ''Starting Out After Rail,'' now in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and ''Pushing for Rail,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "EAKINS, THOMAS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Spellbound"}, "snippet": "Every September, the office of the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee in Cincinnati issues a crisp new edition of ''Paideia,'' a comic-size booklet that lists thousands of obscure words that will appear in spelling bees across the country over the...", "abstract": "Bruce Grierson article on best spelling family in United States--four Goldstein siblings of West Hempstead, NY; says for four of last five years, a Goldstein has placed in top 20 at national bee in Washington; says only handful of families have sent three children to National Spelling Bee, but Goldsteins have matched that and they have good chance of rewriting record book, with six years of eligibility left between two youngest daughters; says Jonathan and Mona Goldstein have spent years drilling their children into championship spellers, but that distinction has isolated their children socially; photos of Mona and Jonathan and children JJ, Amanda, Amy and Ari (L)", "lead_paragraph": "Every September, the office of the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee in Cincinnati issues a crisp new edition of ''Paideia,'' a comic-size booklet that lists thousands of obscure words that will appear in spelling bees across the country over the coming year -- words that any competitive speller in America should know cold. Most families wait for their ''Paideia'' to arrive at school; but serious devotees know when the advance audio version of ''Paideia'' will go up on the Scripps Howard Web site. On that day each year, the Goldsteins of West Hempstead, N.Y. -- Amy, Ari, J.J. and Amanda, along with their parents, Jonathan and Mona -- assemble like the Von Trapps in a thunderstorm. The whole family squeezes into Amy's bedroom and fires up the computer, and the familiar, baronial voice of the National Spelling Bee pronouncer, Alex J. Cameron, carefully enunciates each new addition to the list -- aition, campanile, kittel, giaour. Each Goldstein sits with pen and paper in hand, as still and focused as a game-show contestant, and spells the words, one by one. It takes hours. It is the equivalent, for this family, of the first scrimmage of the year. It signals the beginning of bee season, a long nationwide winnowing process that starts with the 10 million kids who enter class bees in December, passes through countless district and regional bees in the spring and concludes at the National Spelling Bee in late May, leaving a lone speller standing on a stage, holding a jug-handled trophy in clammy hands. Of all the rituals the Goldsteins observe -- and as Orthodox Jews, they observe many -- this is one of the most important and perhaps the most personal. It is a reminder of what binds them, and defines them, as a family.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, AMY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, JJ"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, ARI"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, JONATHAN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, AMANDA"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GOLDSTEIN, MONA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECORDS AND ACHIEVEMENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NATIONAL SPELLING BEE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPELLING"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "A Summer Must-Read With Eerie Echoes"}, "snippet": "IN a cornfield at the edge of an expanding American town, a 14-year-old girl is raped and murdered, her body dismembered and dropped down a sinkhole.
