All these years she'd heard the stories and seen the slides. Now it was her turn. After I had spent a month on my own in Senegal researching a book, Jody joined me for 13 days last March and we traveled more than 1,000 miles in a country that after 20 years, still possesses me. We went from Dakar, on the Atlantic, southeast through villages where I was stationed, near Gambia, to the highlands of the Fouta Djalons and through Niokolo-Koba National Park, then back to Saly-Mbour, a beach resort area south of Dakar. We stayed in comfortable and very affordable accommodations and traveled with guides, a four-wheel-drive vehicle and driver; the cost was under $2,000 for both of us.

Or, the Numbers.'' For many years, this impulse of a director to keep shooting -- whether out of a need to make the film better or a fear of surrendering the completed cut to the studio -- was something film lovers could only read about. Then, with the advent of high-priced laser discs, aficionados had the opportunity to view scenes that directors had been forced to cut from the released versions of films.
