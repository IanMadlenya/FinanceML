Years later, Zanuck had forgotten the name of the movie, but his line remained memorable; indeed, it gave me the title for my biography of him, published in 1971. Zanuck, who would have been 100 on Thursday, was an archetypal figure at the center of the studio system, a man who defined American movies of his time, the 1930's through the 1960's.
