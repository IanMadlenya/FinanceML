(Picador USA, $15.) On one level a multigenerational family epic featuring a retired railroad employee who's losing his marbles, his frazzled wife and their unmoored middle-aged offspring, this novel, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2001, is also a densely subplotted disquisition on the minutiae of railroads, drugs, economics, cuisine, Eastern European politics and lots more. ''If you don't end up liking each one of Franzen's people, you probably just don't like people,'' David Gates wrote here. ''Franzen likes his fiction smart and larky, with glimpses of scary depths.'' EMERGENCE: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software, by Steven Johnson. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) Blending biology, archaeology, computer science and other disciplines, the author examines the phenomenon of swarm logic: the ability of ants -- or brain cells, city neighborhoods or even software programs -- to display greater intelligence collectively than individually, without any centralized control. Last year our reviewer, David Pogue, admired the book's ''wit, clarity and enthusiasm.'' LILI, by Abigail De Witt. (Norton, $13.95.) This tale's terrain is its heroine's interior landscape, a vast region encompassing much of the 20th century and defined less by world events than by her family, her marriage, her loving commitment to her disabled son and her spiritual war with God. The result is an ''engrossing and ambitious first novel,'' Valerie Martin wrote here in 2001. EMBERS, by Sandor Marai. (Vintage International, $12.) Originally published in Budapest in 1942, this novel revolves around an adulterous affair in turn-of-the-century Austria-Hungary. Forty years later, the deceived husband, a former Austrian general, confronts his rival and former friend on the general's Hungarian estate, where the men pass the night chewing over memories, politics and the wearying effects of time on the human heart. In 2001 in these pages, Richard Eder admired the story's ''powerful undercurrent of suspense and its elegantly wrought armature of moral and metaphysical argument.'' THE RACE TO THE WHITE CONTINENT, by Alan Gurney. (Norton, $15.95.) The author tells of the expeditions in the 1830's and 40's that paved the way for the race to the South Pole: at the heart of the story are three competing voyages, one French, one English and the third American. Gurney ''is obviously at home with sailing ships'' and ''with those who manned them,'' Roland Huntford said here in 2000. ''Consequently, there is a refreshing gusto to this book.'' Huntford's biography of the Norwegian polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen (1861-1930), Nansen: The Explorer as Hero (Abacus, $16.95), has also been reissued. Among other things, the dashing Nansen helped popularize skiing as a sport, won a Nobel Peace Prize and achieved worldwide fame with his grueling three-year attempt to reach the North Pole. ''Huntford is masterly at weaving Nansen's life into his times,'' Annette Kobak wrote here in 1999. KISSING IN MANHATTAN, by David Schickler. (Delta, $12.95.) Whether Wall Street traders, lovelorn hipsters or scarred young men from the hinterlands, the characters in these 11 linked stories tend to be die-hard romantic strivers searching for redemption from their problems in the dark whirl of a mythical, surreal New York ruled by the spirit of improbable endings. ''Schickler is a writer of brisk and quirky sentences'' and his ''voice is witty and gently spiky,'' Jennifer Schuessler wrote in these pages in 2001. REPUBLIC.COM, by Cass Sunstein. (Princeton University, $12.95.) A law professor explores the impact of the Internet on American democracy, raising troubling questions about such threats as the dissemination of extremist material and insulation from differing points of view. ''Sunstein writes in a clear and inviting style,'' Stephen Labaton said here last year. ''He performs an important service in casting a skeptical light on a medium more often seen as a utopian technology than as a potentially corrosive force.'' DANCE OF KNIVES, by Donna McMahon. (Tor/Tom Doherty, $15.95.) In 22nd-century Vancouver, where an unspecified ''Collapse'' has left a brutal, lawless society in its wake, a na\u00efve young woman befriends a robotlike giant whose free will has been stolen by a blackmailer. Last year our reviewer, Gerald Jonas, called this an ''ambitious first novel'' that offers ''a technologically aware and emotionally wrenching twist on the old tale of Beauty and the Beast.''
