Directed by Michael Mann (R, 158 minutes). This film is a breakthrough for Mr. Mann. Based on the life of Muhammad Ali, it is Mr. Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds. That subject is a man whose mesmerizing surfeit of supreme athleticism, beauty and moral and physical courage -- and enchanting lack of humility -- had no modern equivalent. The film offers a stunning re-creation of the bouts that Mr. Ali fought. And Mr. Smith as the Greatest captures the fighter's musicality, pausing in midsyllable while ranting and exhaling to punch things up and turn even a joke into something operatic (Elvis Mitchell).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  WALDBAUM, IRA"}, "snippet": "WALDBAUM-Ira.
