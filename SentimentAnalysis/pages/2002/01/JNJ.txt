Performing constantly around New York has given the band a combined tightness and relaxation, the assurance that it can sustain and expand a groove until everyone is dancing.

This 40-year-old museum finally has a home of its own and is celebrating its new quarters by showcasing two important recent gifts. The 400 objects of traditional folk art from Ralph Esmerian include extraordinary caches of portraits and needlework as well as walking sticks, painted furniture, frakturs, ceramics and weather vanes. Rife with acknowledged masterpieces, they raise the museum's collection to a new level while giving folk art itself a new visibility on the city's artscape. The Henry Darger gift, which includes 27 large two-sided watercolors and seven bound volumes by this Chicago recluse, counters the comforts of traditional folk art with a strong dose of the outsider variety, art made for an insatiable community of one. Reflecting the expanding folk-art field, the shows symbolize where the museum comes from and where it is going. Together they indicate that it intends to leave nothing behind. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $5, students and 62+ (Roberta Smith).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Jacobs Is Running Strong In Time for the Millrose", "kicker": "TRACK AND FIELD"}, "snippet": "At 38, with two decades of elite-class running at distances from 800 to 5,000 meters behind her, there seems to be little left for Regina Jacobs to achieve in track and field.
