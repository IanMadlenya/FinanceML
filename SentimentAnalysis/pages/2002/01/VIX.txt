Directed by Michael Mann (R, 158 minutes). This film is a breakthrough for Mr. Mann. Based on the life of Muhammad Ali, it is Mr. Mann's first movie with feeling; his overwhelming love of its subject will turn audiences into exuberant, thrilled fight crowds. That subject is a man whose mesmerizing surfeit of supreme athleticism, beauty and moral and physical courage -- and enchanting lack of humility -- had no modern equivalent. The film offers a stunning re-creation of the bouts that Mr. Ali fought. And Mr. Smith as the Greatest captures the fighter's musicality, pausing in midsyllable while ranting and exhaling to punch things up and turn even a joke into something operatic (Elvis Mitchell).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Japan Leader, Facing Crisis, Moves to Fill Minister's Job"}, "snippet": "Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, moving to contain a growing political and economic crisis, chose Yoriko Kawaguchi today as his new foreign minister, replacing Makiko Tanaka who was fired in what is becoming known here as ''the Tuesday night...", "abstract": "Prime Min Junichiro Koizumi of Japan moves to contain growing political and economic crisis, chosing Yoriko Kawaguchi as his new foreign minister; Koizumi was blindsided by wave of popular anger over his firing of Makiko Tanaka, who appeared nightly on television to push her crusade against Foreign Ministry bureaucrats; photo (M)", "lead_paragraph": "Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, moving to contain a growing political and economic crisis, chose Yoriko Kawaguchi today as his new foreign minister, replacing Makiko Tanaka who was fired in what is becoming known here as ''the Tuesday night massacre.''
