Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If just a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "COMING SOON: HAND-HELD FASHION ADS", "kicker": "WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING: INTERNET"}, "snippet": "A new interactive marketing effort by Banana Republic, the clothing retailer owned by Gap Inc., aims to convert passers-by into holiday-season shoppers.
