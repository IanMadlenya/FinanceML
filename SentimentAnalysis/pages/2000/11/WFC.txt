True, the court largely jettisoned the constitutional questions, and instead granted a limited review of two rarely litigated federal questions. The first involves a constitutional provision leaving the election process to the states; the second rests on an 1887 federal law that appears to ban retroactive changes in legislation that sets rules for choosing electors.", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUSH, GEORGE W"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "POWELL, LEWIS F JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "GORE, AL"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "FLORIDA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "SUPREME COURT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WATERGATE AFFAIR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2000"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Sports of The Times; The Silence of the Giants Could Be a Bit Disquieting"}, "snippet": "AS the Giants practiced in the indoor bubble next to Giants Stadium yesterday for Sunday's showdown with the Redskins, each wore a face mask on his blue-and-red helmet as usual.
