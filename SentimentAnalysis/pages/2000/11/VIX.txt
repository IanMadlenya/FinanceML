The emotion (or is it instinct?) conveyed by the luminous foundling in Katherine Dieckmann's debut film, ''A Good Baby,'' is the driving force in a movie that has the structure and fatalistic mood of an Appalachian folk ballad. Because the baby girl is remarkably happy and outgoing for an infant who was left abandoned in the woods, she melts the hearts of everyone who comes in contact with her. The foundling is the offspring of a traveling salesman and a naive local teenager he murders after she gives birth in the North Carolina backwoods. Accentuated by the twang of old-style country music, this story of seduction, murder and retribution is a potent blend of naturalism and myth. Although the film, based on a novel by Leon Rooke, is set in present-day Appalachia, its variation on the archetype of the traveling salesman and the farm girl seems almost to take place outside of time.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "GOOD BABY, A (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "THOMAS, HENRY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "DIECKMANN, KATHERINE"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "STRATHAIRN, DAVID"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Legg Mason Funds Feel Some of the Pain"}, "snippet": "It is unlikely anybody is more disappointed by Gateway's troubles than William Miller, who oversees the mutual fund operations of the Legg Mason brokerage firm in Baltimore.

Mr. Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on his career as a teenage rock journalist overflows with wonderful performances and memorable moments. Mr. Fugit brings the perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of William Miller, a San Diego teenager who takes to the road with a scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone. ''Almost Famous'' isn't perfect -- it lacks a necessary dimension of demonic sleaze -- but Mr. Crowe's smart, compassionate writing and performances by Mr. Crudup, Ms. Hudson, Jason Lee and Ms. McDormand (among many others) make it hum (A.
