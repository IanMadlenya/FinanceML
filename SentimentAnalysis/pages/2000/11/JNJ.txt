Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If just a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing.

Now Playing * ''ALMOST FAMOUS,'' starring Patrick Fugit, Billy Crudup, Kate Hudson, Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe (R, 120 minutes). Mr. Crowe's loose, affectionate look back on his career as a teenage rock journalist overflows with wonderful performances and memorable moments. Mr. Fugit brings the perfect balance of intelligence and innocence to the role of William Miller, a San Diego teenager who takes to the road with a scruffy band called Stillwater, on assignment for Rolling Stone. ''Almost Famous'' isn't perfect -- it lacks a necessary dimension of demonic sleaze -- but Mr. Crowe's smart, compassionate writing and performances by Mr. Crudup, Ms. Hudson, Jason Lee and Ms. McDormand (among many others) make it hum (A. O. Scott).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Collins Poised to Be Giants' Guiding Force", "kicker": "PRO FOOTBALL"}, "snippet": "Kerry Collins is not planning to follow Coach Jim Fassel to the playoffs.
