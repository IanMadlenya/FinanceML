Its 14 crew members had been lifted off by helicopter on Monday, after gale-force winds had swept the region. The accident happened less than a year after a broken oil tanker fouled miles of Brittany coastline. Donald G. McNeil Jr. FRANCE: A DIANA INQUIRY ENDS A French court ruled that the investigation into the role of paparazzi in the 1997 crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, would remain closed. Mohamed al-Fayed, the tycoon whose son, known as Dodi, was also killed, had appealed a lower court's decision to close the inquiry. The lower court judge had determined that the man responsible for the crash was Mr. Fayed's driver, Henri Paul, who was speeding and under the influence of alcohol and drugs. The behavior of pursuing photographers, the judge ruled, did not constitute a crime under French law. ''None of the questions that are dear to us were ever investigated,'' said one of Mr. Fayed's lawyers, Bernard Dartevelle, after the decision. Donald G.
