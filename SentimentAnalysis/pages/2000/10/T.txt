Unlike the publishing industry, which reserves a very long shelf for the coming-of-age autobiographical roman a clef, the theater can be particularly indifferent to the literature of immaturity, unless it comes in the form of a budget-saving monologue. Otherwise it's most often relegated to the classroom. ''Rice Boy'' by Sunil Kuruvilla, at the Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven, and ''Nocturne,'' by Adam Rapp, at the Hasty Pudding Theater here in a production by the American Repertory Theater, are striking and welcome exceptions to this. Both plays are by men in their 30's, neither of whom has ever before had a full professional production of a work. Both are portrait-of-the-artist tales of growing up. And plaintive as both plays are, they are rescued from the danger of off-putting earnestness by some lyrical writing, muscular in one case, winsome in the other, and, not incidentally, by imaginative and well-acted productions that enhance the theatricality of these young men's stories.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "RICE BOY (PLAY)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KURUVILLA, SUNIL"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "RAPP, ADAM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "YALE REPERTORY THEATER"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICAN REPERTORY THEATER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "THEATER"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "In a Shift, Internet Service Will Pay for Music Rights", "kicker": "TECHNOLOGY"}, "snippet": "Napster, a start-up that has terrified the recording industry by letting its users copy music from each other free over the Internet, agreed yesterday to a plan to change course and charge a fee for its service, distributing part of the fee as...", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "Napster, a start-up that has terrified the recording industry by letting its users copy music from each other free over the Internet, agreed yesterday to a plan to change course and charge a fee for its service, distributing part of the fee as royalties to record companies.
