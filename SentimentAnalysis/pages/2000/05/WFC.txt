The turtles, which nest on ocean beaches and then spend almost all of their lives in the open sea, have been dying in large numbers -- at least 1,500 females every year, by some estimates -- caught in the long lines and nets used by commercial fishermen. This level of mortality, combined with the natural high mortality of turtle hatchlings, means the population is unsustainable, according to the analysis, a computer model devised by scientists at Drexel University in Philadelphia who have studied the turtles' nesting activity at a major site in Costa Rica since 1988.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "PACIFIC OCEAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DREXEL UNIVERSITY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TURTLES AND TORTOISES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ENDANGERED AND EXTINCT SPECIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FISHING, COMMERCIAL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Software to Predict Power Needs"}, "snippet": "IF nothing else, most American computer users have been able to count on one thing: electricity to run their machines.
