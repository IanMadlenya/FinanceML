Mr. McQueen's black-and-white ''Cold Breath'' (shown as both a full-wall projection and as a DVD video) focuses for 10 silent minutes on the artist's own nipple, which he squeezes, twists, strums and pulls with his thumb and index finger.

Directed by Raja Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film, starring the comic whirligig Mr. Lawrence, could best be described as ''Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ''Tootsie'' for flava -- er, flavor. Mr. Lawrence plays Malcolm, an F.B.I. agent with a penchant for doing undercover work in full body makeup. Here he impersonates Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman. Why? Big Momma's granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison. Malcolm believes he can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much of a movie; it looks like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms ever in a film directed by a former editor (Elvis Mitchell).", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Giving a Face and a Voice to Kafka's Cruel Fantasy Father", "kicker": "OPERA REVIEW"}, "snippet": "In Stanley Walden's one-act opera, Franz Kafka's famous ''Letter to My Father'' is furnished with an addressee who not only can be seen but also sings.

The original document -- long, tortured, accusatory and confessional -- was never delivered, nor perhaps was it ever intended to be. If its solitary and private nature is in fact genuine, the premise on which ''Kafka: Letter to My Father'' is made to stand becomes shaky indeed. Mr. Walden's workmanlike stage piece, given a credible and professional production at the Kaye Playhouse on Wednesday night, assumes that having heard of Kafka senior from his son's lips, the audience will want to meet the gentleman in person. This may not be the case at all. The shadow, properly evoked, becomes more palpable than whatever may have cast it, and two examples -- one sublime, the other less so -- come to mind.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "KAFKA: LETTER TO MY FATHER (OPERA)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "SHAPERO, DAVID"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WALDEN, STANLEY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KAFKA, FRANZ"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "KAYE, SYLVIA AND DANNY, PLAYHOUSE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OPERA"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Excerpts From the President's News Conference at the White House"}, "snippet": "Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday at the White House, as recorded by The New York Times:    Prepared Remarks      With less than 35 days left in the legislative year, time is running out for Congress to meet...", "abstract": "Excerpts from Pres Clinton's news conference; photo (M)", "lead_paragraph": "Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday at the White House, as recorded by The New York Times: Prepared Remarks With less than 35 days left in the legislative year, time is running out for Congress to meet its obligations to the American people.
