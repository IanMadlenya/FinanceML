Management is eager to bolster the stock price and believes that issuing a tracking stock might accomplish that if the shrinking consumer long-distance unit was separate.

[A1.] Personal Spending and Income Rise Consumer spending rose by 0.2 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported, matching expectations. Americans' incomes, which include wages, interest and government benefits, rose 0.4 percent in May, slightly more than expected.

Fees for underwriting new issues sank about 20 percent from $3.29 billion in the period a year earlier. [C14.] $765 Million Investment in Italtel Cisco Systems and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice agreed to acquire 80 percent of Telecom Italia's computer network equipment unit, Italtel, for $765 million. The two investors hope that by forging an alliance with Cisco and by making the company independent from its Italian parent, it will become more competitive. The investors said they hope to sell shares of the new company to the public soon. [C4.] Russia Exerts Control Over Gazprom Russia's government strengthened its influence over Gazprom, the natural gas giant. Shareholders voted in a new board, tipping the balance to favor the government, which controls 38.4 percent of the company.
