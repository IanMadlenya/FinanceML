But behind the friendly facade is an ambitious, refreshingly original menu devoted to seafood. The wonderfully diverse raw bar is enticing, and the menu offers so many seductive choices that decisions can be difficult. The appetizers, with choices like Florida stone crab claws and sauteed mussels and snails with a wonderful potato hash, are all excellent. The fine main courses range from the complex (grilled salmon with a falafel crust, perched on a bed of hummus with a lemon-coriander vinaigrette) to the simple (plain fish, perfectly grilled, roasted or poached). The restaurant's wine list is well chosen and varied, with an eye both to value and to the food. 2.
