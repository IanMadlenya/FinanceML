On video he plays a number of characters, most frequently the sleazy, lethally egomaniacal painter Jonathan Grossmalerman (roughly, Big Painting Guy), dripping with sweat, political incorrectness, chemical dependency and self-loathing. Performing in Cologne, Jonathan denounces Joseph Beuys. Lecturing at the Skowhegan School of Painting (with a disco ball instead of slides), he tells students to ''get a studio assistant or get married.'' In some of the funniest if most esoteric bits, he refers to other artists only as ''the Surveillance Lady, the Catholic Hang-Ups Guy, the Bundled Sticks Lady, the Duct-Tape Guy'' and so on. A few are named, including David Salle, whose watercolors Mr. Smit's seem to parody, and Peter Halley. ''He has his own magazine,'' frets Jonathan, referring to Mr. Halley's position as founding publisher of Index.

Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes; winner of best picture, director, cinematography and original-screenplay Oscars). With heavenly finesse Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife.
