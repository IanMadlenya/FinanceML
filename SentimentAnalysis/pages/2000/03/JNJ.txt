This year's 35-artist version, however, is well worth a visit. Concentrating on painting and sculpture, the exhibition is not trendy or controversial and it could use some more editing. Nevertheless, it offers a heartening, interestingly mixed glimpse of the good things possible in art today. Sculpture is represented by works of visceral poetic abstraction by William Tucker, Lynda Benglis, Patrick Strzelec and Lawrence Fane, but painting steals the show. It includes the crusty abstraction of Pat Passlof, the scrambled Victorian Pop of Trevor Winkfield, deft portraits of winsome young men by Elizabeth Peyton and Ellen Gallagher's subtly political fusion of abstraction and doodled fragments of racist cartooning. Throughout there is a rigorous commitment to some notion -- traditional or idiosyncratic -- of aesthetic quality; slacker-style delinquency is blessedly absent.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND LETTERS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ART"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 302, "offset": 0, "time": 56}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
