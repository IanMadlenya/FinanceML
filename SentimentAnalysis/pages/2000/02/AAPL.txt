She said she feared that he would view her as weak or stupid for staying with her husband for so long and that he would try to get rid of her. Eventually she did talk to him and, to her surprise, he gave her a few days off, at his convenience. Before that talk, however, she felt she had nowhere to turn for advice and protection.

The best chardonnays, for example, whether from California or Burgundy or even Australia, tend to be rich and creamy, full of exotic flavors buttressed by sensations of toasty vanilla and butter that are induced by aging in oak barrels. Then there's Chablis, one of my favorite wines and an exception to most other wines made from the chardonnay grape. Genuine Chablis, not to be confused with those jug wines tagged with the name chablis, comes from the Chablis region of France, southeast of Paris. Chablis produces only white wines made from the chardonnay grape, like the best white Burgundies. Though Chablis is generally lumped in with Burgundy, the region is actually about 75 miles north of where most white Burgundies are produced, which partly accounts for the singular nature of Chablis. Because the vineyards are in a much cooler region, Chablis tends to be crisp, lean and taut rather than fat and lush like so many other chardonnays around the world.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "FRANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WINES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "BP AMOCO AGREES TO PURCHASE EL PASO'S STAKE IN PIPELINE", "kicker": "COMPANY NEWS"}, "snippet": "BP Amoco P.L.C. agreed yesterday to buy the El Paso Energy Corporation's one-third stake in a natural gas pipeline that stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to Tennessee.
