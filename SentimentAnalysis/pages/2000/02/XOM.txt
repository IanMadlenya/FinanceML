In ''Not of This World,'' it is sometimes a great task to get through the everyday. Everyone in this loamy soap opera seems slightly depressed -- even Sister Caterina (Margherita Buy), the focus of most of the film. She is roused from her commitment to God and the church when a jogger (Stefano Abbati) stops long enough to light up a smoke and hand her a newborn boy that he found on his run.

When it comes to fashioning a larger context, though, he is more interested in pouring on an old-world melancholy. Mr. Piccioni's film wants to ruminate on faith and family as well as dance with ambiguity. Most of the characters are estranged from conventional families and try to create familial bonds outside the boundaries of home.
