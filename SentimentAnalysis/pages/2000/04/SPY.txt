Yet it is in the tanks at Aqua Bounty Farms on the island off New Brunswick, Canada, that hundreds of truly novel fish swim: schools of genetically engineered salmon that await approval for sale in the United States. These fish look like Atlantic salmon found in groceries around the world, but for their age they are enormous. Endowed with foreign genes that produce growth hormones, they grow to market size -- about seven pounds -- in 18 months, twice as fast as normal salmon.", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "CANADA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AQUA BOUNTY FARMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HORMONES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SALMON"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSSELS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ENDANGERED AND EXTINCT SPECIES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "GENETIC ENGINEERING"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "In Whom Do We Trust?", "kicker": "The Learning Network"}, "snippet": "In this lesson, students explore the issue of the separation of church and state by researching various scenarios that have informed the most recent debate.", "abstract": "In this lesson, students explore the issue of the separation of church and state by researching various scenarios that have informed the most recent debate.", "lead_paragraph": "Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.", "keywords": [{"value": "News", "name": "type_of_material", "rank": "1"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  DARBEE, ELIZABETH ORR"}, "snippet": "DARBEE-Elizabeth Orr.
