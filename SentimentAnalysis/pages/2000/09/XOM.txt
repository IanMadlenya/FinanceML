The troubled young man from the poor background is locked in the frame with his adversary, the sweat flies, there are close-ups of agonized faces and the architecture of oiled and muscled bodies. As more and more women, including Muhammad Ali's daughter, Laila, and Joe Frazier's daughter, Jacqui Frazier-Lyde, take up the sport, it is almost inevitable that films about women who box should follow, too. Now comes ''Girlfight,'' a first feature by Karyn Kusama, which opened Friday. It is the story of a sullen, gum chewing, muscular girl from the underclass, played by Michelle Rodriguez, who literally fights her way into the ring.", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "GIRLFIGHT (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KUSAMA, KARYN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOXING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Waterfront Project Gets $1 Million in Funds", "kicker": "IN BRIEF"}, "snippet": "One million dollars in state planning funds have been secured to aid in the continuing revitalization of the Port Jefferson waterfront, State Senator Kenneth P.
