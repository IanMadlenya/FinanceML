But for Mr. Ebner, a maverick investor who is a kind of Swiss Warren Buffett, Roche Holding was a special case. As recently as 1997, shares in Roche, the pharmaceutical giant based here, accounted for 92 percent of Mr. Ebner's profitable Pharma Vision fund, which rose 24 percent a year, on average, through the 1990's. Then, last year, Roche hit a roadblock. First, the company agreed to pay a half-billion dollars in settlements after the Justice Department accused it of conspiring with other companies to fix worldwide prices for vitamins; the amount exceeded what the company had paid to settle a citric acid price-fixing case two years earlier and a prescription-drug price-fixing case in the 1970's.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "ROCHE HOLDINGS LTD"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPANY AND ORGANIZATION PROFILES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Guides: Cappuccino-Free Bookstores, Cafes With Big Ears", "kicker": "NEW YORK BOOKSHELF"}, "snippet": "GUIDEBOOKS to New York City are always in demand in a place where advice can quickly become outdated.
