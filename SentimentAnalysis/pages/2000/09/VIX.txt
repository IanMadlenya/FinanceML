But for Mr. Ebner, a maverick investor who is a kind of Swiss Warren Buffett, Roche Holding was a special case. As recently as 1997, shares in Roche, the pharmaceutical giant based here, accounted for 92 percent of Mr. Ebner's profitable Pharma Vision fund, which rose 24 percent a year, on average, through the 1990's. Then, last year, Roche hit a roadblock. First, the company agreed to pay a half-billion dollars in settlements after the Justice Department accused it of conspiring with other companies to fix worldwide prices for vitamins; the amount exceeded what the company had paid to settle a citric acid price-fixing case two years earlier and a prescription-drug price-fixing case in the 1970's.", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "ROCHE HOLDINGS LTD"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPANY AND ORGANIZATION PROFILES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}]}, {"headline": {"main": "Academic Gains Pay Off for Teachers and Students"}, "snippet": "Several times a month, in preparation for a statewide math exam later this school year, the opening minutes of every 9th and 10th grade class at Northwest Cabarrus High are devoted to math, no matter whether the class is Latin, history or physical...", "abstract": "Three-year-old North Carolina education program, which treats teachers like shareholders and students like sales clerks vying to meet quotas, is being closely watched; when performance on statewide tests improves, teachers are given cash bonuses and students are given cards entitling them to discounts at local shops; photos (M)", "lead_paragraph": "Several times a month, in preparation for a statewide math exam later this school year, the opening minutes of every 9th and 10th grade class at Northwest Cabarrus High are devoted to math, no matter whether the class is Latin, history or physical education.
