After attending NYU and NYU Medical School, he and his brother, Dr. Julius Miller joined the US Navy as medical officers. He served with distinction in the Pacific Theater during WWII and, was present during the battles of Iwo Jima (witnessed the raising of the flag), Okinawa and Guam in the Philippines. After 4\u00c2\u00bd years of service to his country, Dr. Miller recommitted himself to the profession of medicine specializing in Obstetrics/Gynecology and ultimately Fertility/Sterility and Cancer. In collaboration with fellow physicians from the Soviet Union, in the early 1960's he was responsible for introducing into the US the 'cervical sling', allowing for successful outcomes to very difficult pregnancies. In private practice he became one of New York City's most highly respected fertility and cancer specialists. Dr. Miller's attending privileges included: New York Infirmary Hospital, Bellevue Hospital, Beth Israel Medical Center, New York University Langone Hospital, and the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn Medical Center. Starting in 1952, Dr. Miller's passion for medicine and teaching led him to establish a post-graduate relationship with NYU Medical School as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology. A pioneer in the advocacy of women's access to health care and reproductive rights, in 1953 Dr. Miller began donating part of his time to what became a life-long commitment to providing health care to members' families of the Mens' Clothing Workers Union at the Hillman Center in Manhattan. In the late 1960's Dr. Miller opened his 3rd office in New York across the hall from the joint practice of his father and brother (Dr. I. William Miller and Dr. Julius Miller). In 1972, following the US Supreme Court's Decision 'Roe v Wade', in partnership with Dr. Mansoor Day and Dr. Roy Gold, Dr Miller founded VIP Medical Associates in association with Beth Israel Medical Center, the first clinical practice to open in New York State devoted to providing abortion services to women of limited financial means. Continuing in private practice though his 90th birthday, his many honors and recognition included: Diplomate, American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Fellow, American College of Surgeons; Fellow, International College of Surgeons; Fellow, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Chairman, Committee on Admissions, NY Academy of Medicine; Fellow, Pan American Medical Association; Fellow, American Fertility Society. In a statement made shortly after Dr. Miller's death, Dr. Anthony Greco, Associate Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, said of Dr. Miller \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6he set the bar\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. His was a large life defined by more than his career. He was Arthur in his private life and found equal joy in his roles as a devoted husband, father, grandfather, father-in-law, and friend. He loved traveling with his family, ocean swimming, winning rounds of golf, telling (and retelling!) bawdy jokes, attending the symphony and the opera in a tuxedo and cape with red lining, wearing a finely cut suit set off by the perfectly selected tie, and sharing good meals and fine wine with those he loved. More than anything, he loved seeing the transformation of his lovely granddaughter Ruth into a fine young woman A well lived life cannot help but leave a large absence when it ends. Dr. Arthur Miller will long be remembered and missed deeply by all who knew and loved him. A member of the Town and Village Synagogue, he is survived by his wife of 63 years Hope Simon, sons Lane (of Seattle, WA) and Lloyd (of Anchorage, Alaska), daughters-in-law Anne and Heather, and granddaughter Ruth. He was preceded in death by his son Scott.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}], "meta": {"hits": 2126, "offset": 0, "time": 57}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
