Vincent L. Bogart was born on the family farm near Kirwin, KS, on June 8, 1922. Vince died on Monday, March 26, in his home surrounded by loved ones. After high school and one year of college, he traveled to Washington, D.C., and became a Federal Reserve Board page. He attended George Washington University at night, joined Sigma Nu, and enlisted in the Army Air Force Cadets in August 1942. Vince was commissioned as a 1st Lieutenant fighter pilot, was assigned to the Aleutians and later trained combat pilots before his inactivation. With the GI Bill running out, he began at Kansas State University and met his future wife, Julia R. Henry, in April 1951, on a blind date. They both loved acting and appeared in plays together and each received a best actor Oscar. After marriage in August 1952, he entered Washburn Law School. Graduated in 1955 with a LLB, he was hired by a large Wichita law firm, served one term in the Kansas state legislature, was elected president of the West Side Democratic Club and Chairman for Sedgwick County Democratic Committee. In 1960, John Kennedy appealed to Vince for support with the Kansas delegation to win the nomination in July and the election in November. Vince hosted Kennedy's first visit to Wichita and drove Ted Sorensen and Larry O'Brien to campaign speeches. Sorensen and O'Brien joked in the car that Kennedy was such a speech deviant. Ted Kennedy also came to Wichita to promote his brother's candidacy. Vince started his own law firm and was elected to the Wichita City Commission in 1963-67 and as Mayor in 1964-65. He represented Wichita at Orleans Joan d' Arc festival and gave a speech in perfect French. Judy and Vince were invited with other Mayors to meet President Johnson at the White House. The mayors discussed the Vietnam War with the President. Afterwards, the couple dined and joined others dancing in the foyer. President Johnson cut-in to dance with Judy and drawled \"Are you having a good time?\" During Vince's tenure, he supported Johnson's war on poverty, passed a fair housing law, and signed a contract to construct Century II. He became Chairman State Democratic Platform Committee in 1966-67, was appointed WSU Board trustee, and then Governor Docking chose him as legislative representative. He was later appointed to the State Board of Regents. In 1968 Vince served on National Democratic Platform Committee and attended the Chicago National Convention as delegate. The Chicago convention was interrupted with a show of force between demonstrators and Mayor Daley's police. The joke among the delegates was to nominate Hubert Humphrey as President and Vince as Vice-President so the ticket would read Humphrey Bogart. In 1972-74 and 1976-77, he was special assistant to the Attorney General, State of Kansas. Vince served on the local, state and national Bar Associations, was a member of the state and local Trial Lawyers Association and was recognized in Who's Who in American Politics and Who's Who in American Lawyers. Vince served under Governor Sebelius as Judge of the Workmen's Compensation Court and ended his career as of counsel with a local law firm. Survivors include his much loved wife of nearly 60 years, Judy, their lovely children Candace Miller, Lee Bogart, Celeste Racette, and Cynthia Sandin, and their spouses. \"Oompa\" was the name affectionately given to him by his grandchildren; Renee, Matthew and Robert Racette, Janelle and Andrea Bogart, and Caitlin and Anders Miller.
