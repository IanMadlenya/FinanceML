A son of Daniel Redmond and the former Mildred Phelan, Jack was born in Berwyn, PA on December 1st, 1930. After graduation from Villanova University with a BS in Civil Engineering in 1953, he was commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy as a Chief Engineer on the USS Robert L. Wilson (DDE847), retiring as a Lieutenant in 1958. Upon discharge from the Navy, Jack joined the Wilbur B. Driver Company, a family owned manufacturer of alloys, and earned his M.S. in Metallurgy at Stevens Institute of Technology in 1960. After the subsequent sale of the Wilbur B. Driver Co. to GTE in 1967, Jack left the manufacturing business and became a Member of the New York Stock Exchange, joining the brokerage firm Carlisle DeCoppet & Company. In 1970, he became a general partner of Fowler, Rosenau & Company, the NYSE Specialist firm. He retired in 1995 as the firm's senior partner. Mr Redmond lived in Llewellyn Park, West Orange for many years where, with his former wife Claire Driver Redmond, who passed away in 2003, he raised six children, John Jr. (Nancy), Robert (Elise), Suzanne Anderson (Robert), Richard (Jane), Paul (Donna), and Ruth Bloom (William). He also maintained former residences in Longboat Key, Florida; Bondville, Vermont; and Convent Station, New Jersey. He was an important Benefactor to his beloved Villanova University, and was recognized as a Distinguished Alumni in 1988 and became a member of the President's Forum in 1995. He was also a member of the Presidents Council at St. Elizabeth's College, and served for many years on the Boards of Newark Academy and the Montclair Community Hospital. He was a former member and trustee of the Essex County Country Club and at the time of his death was a Member Emeritus of the Baltusrol Golf Club where he was an avid golfer. In addition, he was an enthusiastic member of the choir at Notre Dame of Mt. Carmel Church. Among many things, he will be remembered as a beloved patriarch, true friend, mentor to many, great partner, story and joke teller extraordinaire, and not the least, a distinguished gentleman. He is pre-deceased by his brother, William and a grandchild, William John, and is survived by his six children, three Khandalavala stepchildren, Dorab (Gitte), Dina, and Rustom (Maartje), seventeen grandchildren, six step-grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and three siblings.
