Donald J. Herman, who rose to prominence as a software-development visionary in the 1960s and '70s, died on June 24 at home in Tampa, Fla. He was 82. Mr. Herman was born in 1930 in Aberdeen, S.D., the fourth of five children to Jacob and Mary Herman. He graduated from Aberdeen's Central High School and later worked his way through the University of South Dakota to earn an engineering degree. Mr. Herman served twelve years in the US Navy, six years as a U.S. Naval Intelligence Officer assigned to the National Security Agency. In 1962 Mr. Herman co-founded COMRESS Inc., an early pioneer in the development and leasing of proprietary software. Ultimately, the entrepreneurial engineer would use COMRESS-profit \"seed money\" to start five other computer-related companies. The most notable was COMTEN, which Mr. Herman sold to the NCR Corp. in 1979. He would, in turn, become the Chief Executive of NCR. He also founded two nonprofit organizations, the Corporation For Open Systems and UNIX International, which helped establish software standards for the international computer industry. He would later chair the U.S. Department of Defense Computer & Communications Cost Reductions Committee. After taking early retirement in 1988, Mr. Herman relocated from Dayton, Oh. to Naples, Fla., where he married Joan. His community involvements ranged from the Miami Valley Hospital Board of Trustees to the vice chairmanship of the Naples Chapter of the American Red Cross. The Hermans moved to Tampa in the fall of 2008. Mr. Herman is survived by his wife, Joan; brothers, Vernon and Harlow; sister, Cleo (Donovan); sons, Daniel (spouse, Judith), Jeffrey (Jeanette), James (Jane), David (Sandy), Robert (Doreen) and stepson Paul Stock (Bonnie); daughters, Julie (David Holt) and stepdaughter Stephani (Rodrigo Vallejo); 14 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. Mr. Herman was preceded in death by his father, Jacob; mother, Mary; and brother, Bernard. Visitation services will be held Friday, June 29 from 5:30pm to 7:30pm at Blount & Curry Funeral Homes, 605 S. MacDill Ave. Memorial services will be held Saturday, June 30 at 11:00am at St. John's Episcopal Church, 906 S.
