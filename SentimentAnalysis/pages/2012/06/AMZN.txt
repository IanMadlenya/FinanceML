Donald J. Herman, who rose to prominence as a software-development visionary in the 1960s and '70s, died on June 24 at home in Tampa, Fla. He was 82. Mr. Herman was born in 1930 in Aberdeen, S.D., the fourth of five children to Jacob and Mary Herman. He graduated from Aberdeen's Central High School and later worked his way through the University of South Dakota to earn an engineering degree. Mr. Herman served twelve years in the US Navy, six years as a U.S. Naval Intelligence Officer assigned to the National Security Agency. In 1962 Mr. Herman co-founded COMRESS Inc., an early pioneer in the development and leasing of proprietary software. Ultimately, the entrepreneurial engineer would use COMRESS-profit \"seed money\" to start five other computer-related companies. The most notable was COMTEN, which Mr. Herman sold to the NCR Corp. in 1979. He would, in turn, become the Chief Executive of NCR. He also founded two nonprofit organizations, the Corporation For Open Systems and UNIX International, which helped establish software standards for the international computer industry. He would later chair the U.S. Department of Defense Computer & Communications Cost Reductions Committee. After taking early retirement in 1988, Mr. Herman relocated from Dayton, Oh. to Naples, Fla., where he married Joan. His community involvements ranged from the Miami Valley Hospital Board of Trustees to the vice chairmanship of the Naples Chapter of the American Red Cross. The Hermans moved to Tampa in the fall of 2008. Mr. Herman is survived by his wife, Joan; brothers, Vernon and Harlow; sister, Cleo (Donovan); sons, Daniel (spouse, Judith), Jeffrey (Jeanette), James (Jane), David (Sandy), Robert (Doreen) and stepson Paul Stock (Bonnie); daughters, Julie (David Holt) and stepdaughter Stephani (Rodrigo Vallejo); 14 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. Mr. Herman was preceded in death by his father, Jacob; mother, Mary; and brother, Bernard. Visitation services will be held Friday, June 29 from 5:30pm to 7:30pm at Blount & Curry Funeral Homes, 605 S. MacDill Ave. Memorial services will be held Saturday, June 30 at 11:00am at St. John's Episcopal Church, 906 S.

A stronger bond between two souls would be hard to find. They were lucky to have each other and enjoyed every moment of every day fully, with boundless respect, kindness, patience and love for one another. They truly lived a love story. Evelyn's interests and curiosities were limitless and life experiences many. Few people knew that she earned her pilot's license at the age of 19 and jumped 12 times at the old Harrisburg, PA airport. She had so many loves - her pets (dogs, cats and parakeets), anything from Tiffany's, the Sunday New York Times, auctions and antiques, Frank Sinatra (Strangers in the Night, Fly Me to the Moon - and all the rest), hard shell crabs and a beer or two, horse races and slot machines, slightly off-color jokes, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Blue Angels, flowers and \"pretty things\", her convertibles, shopping for anything, Ocean City summers, driving and exploring and making friends. A good and generous friend to many, she was always ready to listen and never missed a chance to provide a kindness. Almost 5'2\" and with a commanding presence, Evelyn could be as tough as nails. She met her life's many challenges head on with unbelievable strength and courage. Evelyn has been a wonderful mother to three girls: Jessica, Laurie and Jennie. It gave her great pleasure to spend time with her children - teaching, guiding and caring for them. She was always ready to tell a story, share a kindness and be quick with a smile and a laugh. A voracious reader who loved to learn about almost anything and everything, she was embracing the new technologies and the world they opened up to her. Dick and Evelyn were partners in creating and operating Dick Jones Sales, Inc., a nationwide industrial equipment distributorship. For many years, Evelyn also operated her pride and joy enterprise, Evelyn Jones Antiques and Surprises in New Oxford, PA where she enjoyed a clientele from near and far. Her extensive knowledge of, special interest in, and collections of carousel horses, majolica, oyster plates, silver and fine porcelains have afforded her a national reputation in some circles. A loving wife, mother, grandmother and friend - Evelyn provided joy and inspiration to the many lives she touched. She will always be in our hearts and we will forever love her and miss her.
