O'CONNOR -->O'CONNOR--Diane Elizabeth, 63, after a determined 12-year battle with Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), a rare neurological disease. She leaves behind a loving life partner of 40 years, Carol Leudesdorf and their two sons, Timothy and Robert O'Connor, and many other family and friends. Diane (Doc) spent her entire career at publishing firm W.W. Norton & Company, Inc in NYC. Hired as a production trainee in 1971, Diane completed her Norton career 36 years later as Vice President and Director of Manufacturing. In those decades, she oversaw the production of books on diverse topics from sailing to statistics, and most notably, on Norton's distinguished college English list, best known for the Norton Anthologies. Diane's dedication to Norton, her delight in making beautiful books, and her collegiality and humor made her a beloved colleague. Diane grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., was a graduate of Mount Vernon College, in Washington, D.C. and Iona College, in New Rochelle, and received an MBA from Baruch College in NYC. One of her greatest pleasures in life was to putter and garden while spending time with her family and friends at their cottage in Orient, L.I. Diane was an avid athlete pursuing sailing, biking, and swimming. She was a nationally ranked squash player when MSA first appeared. Diane maintained an active social life throughout her illness and fought very hard to counteract the effects of this devastating disease. Her generosity, honesty and outspoken manner, as well as her indomitable spirit, have been an inspiration to all. Visitation Friday 2-4 and 7-9pm at John J. Fox Funeral Home in Larchmont. Funeral service Saturday 11am at St. Thomas Church in Mamaroneck.
