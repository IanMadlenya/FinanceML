The Trustees and staff of The Metropolitan Museum of Art mourn the passing of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, whose wise stewardship and tireless devotion benefited this institution in countless ways over the past four decades. A Trustee since 1968, he served as Chairman of the Board from 1987 to 1998, bringing humanity, experience, sound judgment, and gentle dignity to the role. Among the many major initiatives launched under his exemplary leadership was an ambitious capital campaign that provided for the Met's endowment and enabled the completion of many significant capital projects. From 1999 on, he continued to guide and participate in the Museum as Trustee Emeritus. \"Punch\" attributed his lifelong commitment to the Met to his boyhood fascination with the works on display in the Arms and Armor Galleries, and he was a generous supporter of the Museum both personally and through The Sulzberger Foundation Inc. He directed his gifts primarily to the Arms and Armor Department -- which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this month -- to enhance its growth and development through acquisitions, the renovation and reinstallation of galleries, and the establishment of a curatorship. In recognition of his generosity, the Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Gallery for special exhibitions of arms and armor was designated in 2002. Punch was a treasured member of the Metropolitan Museum's family, whose unfailing warmth and appreciation for the staff was returned in kind, and we will remember him with the greatest respect and affection. We offer our condolences to Arthur, Karen, Cathy, Cynthia, and the entire Sulzberger family. Daniel Brodsky, Chairman Thomas P. Campbell, Director and CEO Emily K.
