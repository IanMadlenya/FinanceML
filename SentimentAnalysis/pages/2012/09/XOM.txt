Bob's dream and passion had always followed a single-minded focus: business and finance. In 1964, after spending 10 years at the New England Trust Company in Boston, Bob joined the then private investment firm Lazard Freres & Co. As a General Partner at Lazard from 1966 to 1976, he worked in the then relatively new area of mergers and acquisitions, before taking a job as CFO of Ticor in Los Angeles. Within a year of the move, Holmes was the acting President and COO of the financial services giant. From 1980 to 2000, Bob acted as President and COO of Aristar, Inc., President and Director of Great Western Financial Corp, and as Senior Managing Director of Onex Corporation. Upon his return to New York City, Bob was an Executive Advisor to several divisions of the Mitsubishi Corporation. He also worked in various executive and advisory capacities with Lens Advisors and Ripplewood Holdings, LLC., before retiring to Naples, Florida with his wife. No day in Bob's life was complete, anywhere in the world, without a trip to the store to pick up The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Bob Holmes is survived by his wife Karin, brothers Dave and Chuck, son Peter and wife Karen, and two grand children, Duncan and Hanna.
