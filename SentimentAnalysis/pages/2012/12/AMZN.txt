The eldest child of Clarence Y. and Ruth K. Palitz of New York City, Mr. Palitz was 88. When he retired from the finance business in 1996, he was Chairman of Financial Federal Corporation, which he co-founded with his brother, the late Clarence Y. Palitz, Jr. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the company was acquired by People's United Financial, Inc. in 2010. A keen collector and patron of the arts, Mr. Palitz sponsored many shows in New York City, including the Frans Hals and Vermeer and The Milkmaid exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art held in 2009 and 2011, and Michelangelo: The Man and the Myth at the Palitz Gallery in Syracuse University's Lubin House in 2008. Educated at the Ethical Culture and Fieldston schools in New York City, Mr. Palitz graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. His college years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied chemical engineering and business administration, were interrupted by World War II. By the fall of 1944 and the following winter, he was an infantryman in the U.S. Army on the front lines in France and Germany. His job was carrying fifty pound boxes of ammunition for machine guns. Seriously wounded in action, he rarely spoke about his wartime experiences. Mr. Palitz began his business career working for his father in 1947 at Credit America Corporation, a pioneer in the equipment finance field, which was sold to James Talcott, Inc. in 1958. Five years later, the Palitz brothers started their first publicly held company, Commercial Alliance Corporation, which they ran until 1984, when it was sold to First Interstate Bancorp. Mr. Palitz was a Trustee of the Worcester Museum, the Addison Gallery at Phillips Academy, and was a member of MIT's Council for the Arts. He was also a benefactor of the schools he attended, as well as Syracuse University, Rockefeller University, and Haverford College, where he served on the college's Board of Managers. He is survived by his wife of 61 years, Louise Beringer Palitz, his daughter, Anne Bucala, and son-in-law, Dr. Richard Bucala, his son, Gregory, and daughter-in-law, Susan Kane, and five grandchildren, Sam, Ben and Emma Palitz, and Nicole and Paul Bucala.

Same-day shipping is logistically complicated and money-losing \u2014 and may not even be a service that consumers want or need, analysts say. But retailers big and small are willing to take the risk. Even the Postal Service has introduced a same-day option for retailers. And the reason is simple: fear of Amazon.com.\r\n\r\n<p>Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer, has hinted that it will expand its same-day shipping service, giving customers the immediate gratification that has been the biggest advantage of brick-and-mortar stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big retailers like Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Macy\u2019s and Target have worked with eBay to deliver items the same day, as have other old-line stores. Google has begun testing a local delivery service with several chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots going on in this space, and it\u2019s all driven by Amazon,\u201d said Tom Allason, founder and chief executive of Shutl, a British same-day delivery service that will expand to the United States next year. \u201cIt\u2019s not really being driven by consumers at the moment.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same-day delivery idea was a spectacular failure during the dot-com boom. Companies like Kozmo.com and Webvan went under because the services simply cost too much to be profitable. Amazon has offered same-day shipping since 2009, but with limits \u2014 only in big cities near Amazon warehouses on certain items ordered in the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The geographical limits exist because Amazon had built warehouses far from major cities to avoid charging sales tax in certain states. But it has now given in on the sales tax fight, and in return, is erecting warehouses near cities like San Francisco, which analysts say is paving the way for faster, more widespread same-day delivery and spurring competitors.</p>", "lead_paragraph": null, "keywords": []}], "meta": {"hits": 92, "offset": 0, "time": 517}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
