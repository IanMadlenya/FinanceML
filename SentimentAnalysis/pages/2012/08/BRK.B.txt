(Showtime) OUR IDIOT BROTHER (2011) Ned, a sweet, goofy man-child played by Paul Rudd, above, trustingly sells a bag of weed to a police officer in a bohemian stretch of upstate New York and lands in jail. After he's released on parole, he goes home to find that his lady friend (Kathryn Hahn) has taken up with another hippie type and refuses to give up custody of Willie Nelson, their dog. So Ned heads to Brooklyn, crashing with each of his three sisters (Emily Mortimer, Zooey Deschanel and Elizabeth Banks) and upending their cosmopolitan routines in this comedy, directed by Jesse Peretz from a screenplay by Evgenia Peretz (his sister) and David Schisgall. ''Far too much in 'Our Idiot Brother' is much too easy, including the soft, sentimental indulgence it lavishes on Ned and the satirical barbs it flings at his sisters,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. Still, he added, ''This dude, who had seemed at first glance to be a lesser Lebowski, content to tend his garden and smoke a few nice buds, turns out to be a curiously retrograde paladin: the reluctant scourge and benevolent protector of bossy, wayward and otherwise messed-up women. And for all its sweetness, this movie leaves behind the sour taste of unexamined male entitlement. However clever those sisters may be, they cannot do it for themselves. Even if he's an idiot, brother knows best.''
