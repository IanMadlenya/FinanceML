Mr. MacArthur, beloved by many in the Philadelphia theater community, was last seen \"on the boards\" when he received the 2009 Barrymore Lifetime Achievement Award, Philadelphia's version of the Tony Awards. This was a highpoint in a long and illustrious career in the theater. Mr. MacArthur was born in Birmingham, AL in 1929. The son of a prominent businessman, he was groomed to do the same. Educated at Kent School in Connecticut, he received his B.A. from Dartmouth College and finally his M.B.A. from Harvard University. He had no real experience in the theater until a friend took him to see a production at Baylor University in Waco, TX directed by the famous innovator, Paul Baker. He knew immediately that theater was what he wanted to do. After receiving his M.A. from Baylor, Mr.<br/><br/> MacArthur was hired as the Director of the Arkansas Arts Center - funded generously by Winthrop Rockefeller. He established a professional theater degree program that produced actors of national recognition. His production of a play about the state prison system was suppressed before it opened, and evolved into the movie Brubaker with Robert Redford and Jane Alexander. Mr. MacArthur was then appointed as chairman of the Theater Department at San Francisco State University during the time of student riots against the Vietnam War. During that explosive time, he directed Marat Sade. A year later, he was approached by Herbert Blau, then co-director of the Julliard School, and Robert Corrigan, founder of the NYU TISCH School of the Arts, to join them in the creation of a new college training program funded by the Disney family. Mr. MacArthur recruited students and formulated the curriculum of what is now The California Institute of the Arts. Three years later, Mr. MacArthur was chosen to lead the Master of Fine Arts program in Theater for Temple University. During his twenty-five years at Temple, he recruited and trained many actors who continue to work and thrive in the profession. He also directed many plays, notably: \"Noises Off,\" \"The Time of your Life,\" \"Our Country's Good,\" \"Three Sisters\" and \"The Cherry Orchard.\" His production of \"Moby Dick Rehearsed\" won the Best Ensemble at the American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Regionally, he directed at People's Light & Theatre Company, Villanova Shakespeare Company, The Pennsylvania Festival for New Plays, Philadelphia Theatre Company, and Act II Playhouse. He also directed at the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, the Hopkins Center at Dartmouth College, The Loeb Drama Center at Harvard University, and StageWest in Springfield, MA. After retiring from Temple University, Mr. MacArthur was a director, consultant and board member for the Lantern Theater. He directed several plays for Lantern including \"The Bacchae,\" \"Speed the Plow,\" \"Copenhagen\" and \"Novecento.\" He was nominated for a Barrymore award in 1998 for \"The Steward of Christendom,\" and also won a Barrymore in 1996 for his direction of \"The Lower Depths\" for The Venture Theater. Mr. MacArthur is survived by his wife, Christine, daughters Gwyneth, Meredith, and Alexandra, his son, Lorne, grandchildren, Kira Hanlan, Brigid and Rhys MacArthur- Thompson, and three great- grandchildren: Maeve, Fiona, and Colleen Dougherty. Memorial Service will be held at 3pm on Monday, October 5, 2015, The Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral, 19 S. 38th Street, Philadelphia, PA. A reception will follow the service.

My father was betrayed, and utterly undone by some fault of his brain chemistry or arrhythmia of its circuitry. He spent the best years of his life and career researching the structures of the human brain, a twist both bitter and ironic. His depression today would probably be termed treatment resistant depression. But he was also unable to benefit from all of the advances in pharmacology and treatment which have occurred in the past quarter century. My father wrote a text book entitled Physiological Psychology, published in 1980. Reading the section on depression and manic depression, is especially poignant for me. He succinctly described what was then known about the disorder, its symptoms, and treatment. On those pages he was describing himself. Did he know he had it? If so, tragically, he did not seek treatment. Depression took a heavy toll on my father, and on all aspects of his life, during the ups and downs of his illness his family, his work and research also fell victim. He made bad, audaciously poor decisions - which lead to even further immiseration. Depression is a disease of loneliness. My father never talked about it. But he should have. It would have helped him to know that someone was paying attention. I tried to - but when I was a child, adolescent, and young man I had no real understanding of the nature of depression. The last decade of his life was terribly hard, his suffering must have been intense. He wanted so desperately to live -but eventually he reached a point of despair where he just could not hold on any longer. My father was a wonderful, lovely, and, very kind man. He had that particular degree of empathy those who have known suffering can have. His kindness is what I remember best. I never had the chance to forgive him for all that went wrong, but more importantly: I never thanked him for all that went right and for all the good he did. I never told him all that he meant to me, how much I truly loved him, or - goodbye. Dr. Thomas S. Brown was my father. I loved him. And I will miss him forevermore.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Business Highlights", "print_headline": "Business Highlights"}, "snippet": "", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Judge Finalizes Actor Gary Oldman's Divorce From 4th Wife", "print_headline": "Judge Finalizes Actor Gary Oldman's Divorce From 4th Wife"}, "snippet": "A judge has finalized Oscar-nominated actor Gary Oldman's divorce from his fourth wife after six years of marriage.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "A judge has finalized Oscar-nominated actor Gary Oldman's divorce from his fourth wife after six years of marriage.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Treasury: Nov. 5 Deadline for Congress to Act on Debt Limit", "print_headline": "Treasury: Nov. 5 Deadline for Congress to Act on Debt Limit"}, "snippet": "The deadline for Congress to increase the government's borrowing limit is coming earlier than expected, moving up to about Nov. 5.", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "The deadline for Congress to increase the government's borrowing limit is coming earlier than expected, moving up to about Nov. 5.", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Experian Says 15M Have Info Stolen in Hack of T-Mobile Data", "print_headline": "Business Briefing; Hackers Found Information on 15 Million T-Mobile Users"}, "snippet": "Hackers have stolen personal information belonging to about 15 million T-Mobile wireless customers and potential customers in the U.S., including Social Security numbers, home addresses, birthdates and other personal information.", "abstract": "Hackers steal personal information from credit reporting agency Experian that belongs to 15 million T-Mobile wireless customers and potential customers in United States; information includes Social Security numbers and home addresses.", "lead_paragraph": "Hackers have stolen personal information belonging to about 15 million T-Mobile wireless customers and potential customers in the U.S., including Social Security numbers, home addresses, birthdates and other personal information.", "keywords": [{"value": "T-Mobile US Inc", "is_major": "Y", "rank": "1", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Experian PLC", "is_major": "Y", "rank": "2", "name": "organizations"}, {"value": "Cyberattacks and Hackers", "is_major": "Y", "rank": "3", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Privacy", "is_major": "N", "rank": "4", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "Cellular Telephones", "is_major": "N", "rank": "5", "name": "subject"}]}], "meta": {"hits": 2864, "offset": 0, "time": 58}}, "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2013 The New York Times Company.
