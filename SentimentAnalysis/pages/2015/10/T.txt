J. Ross, age 93, known to his friends as Jack, peacefully passed away at his home on Friday, October 30th, 2015 following an eight year battle with vascular dementia. Jack was born to Benjamina Gaynell Cook Ross and John Daniel Ross on June 2, 1922 in Tampa, Florida. He attended school in Tampa, graduating from Tampa College High (Jesuit High School) as a top scholar and Eagle Scout, and later, at age 19 , from Georgia Institute of Technology, with a degree in civil engineering. Following his graduation from Georgia Tech, where he was a member of Sigma Nu Fratenity, Jack studied aeronautical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology until the outbreak of World War II. He immediately entered military service in the Seabees, an engineering division of the US Navy. Jack was stationed in the Aleutian Islands, and, at the end of the war, at Opa Locka Air Station, Miami, Florida. In 1947, Jack founded the engineering firm Riley and Ross with a fellow Navy engineer. When his partner joined the Vietnam War effort, Jack agreed to stay and run the company, later acquiring a total interest and renaming the company H.J. Ross and Associates, Inc. Jack retired in 1978 and sold the company to Monenco Engineering Corporation. The company has subsequently been sold a number of times but still operates today in Miami as TYLin/H.J. Ross. His firm maintained offices in pre- Castro Cuba, Caracas, Venezuela and throughout Florida, namely in St. Petersburg, Ft. Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral, and Miami. Having designed the test facility for the Pratt/Whitney engines powering the Apollo space mission, H.J. Ross and Associates, Inc. also had a base in Huntsville, Alabama. Among the hundreds of major projects Jack's firm engineered, many are of particular note: signature hotels on Miami Beach including The Eden Roc, The Fontainebleau, The Deauville, and The Shelbourne, all Burdines department stores, the Eastern Airlines buildings at MIA, major parts of the Palmetto Expressway, dozens of facilities for Dade County Public Schools and various Marriott Hotels throughout the country. Jack had many passions: art, thoroughbred horses, history, hunting, boating, fishing and traveling, all of which he actively engaged, living life to the fullest. Jack was a long time member of Epiphany Catholic Church and a former Board Member of Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. He is predeceased by two of his daughters, Barbara Gaynelle Ross and Suzanne Mary Ross, as well as his parents and his sister, Sara Longmire. He is survived by his wife of thirty six years, Audrey Hand Jackson Ross, as well as his two daughters from his first marriage to Donna Guilfoyle Ross, Julie Ross Dunn Myers and Sally Ross Muccio (husband, Craig, and daughter, Donna), all of Miami. His is also survived by his wife's daughter, Melissa Jackson Loree, DVM (husband, Lee, and son, Oliver), of Atlanta, Georgia, as well as a number of nieces and nephews. A service celebrating his life well lived will take place on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2015 at 10:30am at Epiphany Catholic Church, 8235 SW 57th Ave., Miami, Florida 33143.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  HERZFELD, WOLFGANG "}, "snippet": "HERZFELD--Wolfgang, age 93, beloved husband of Eva (Rosenthal); father of Judith Herzfeld and Deborah Cline; father-in-law of Robert Griffin and Jonathan Cline; grandfather of Tamara Cline Koelle, Sarah Griffin, Rachel Griffin and Arielle Cline;...", "abstract": null, "lead_paragraph": "<!-- WOLFGANG HERZFELD -->HERZFELD--Wolfgang, age 93, beloved husband of Eva (Rosenthal); father of Judith Herzfeld and Deborah Cline; father-in-law of Robert Griffin and Jonathan Cline; grandfather of Tamara Cline Koelle, Sarah Griffin, Rachel Griffin and Arielle Cline; grandfather-in-law of David Koelle and Ian McCormick; and great-grandfather of Alyssa Rose Koelle and Noah Griffin McCormick.
