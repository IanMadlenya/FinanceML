J. Ross, age 93, known to his friends as Jack, peacefully passed away at his home on Friday, October 30th, 2015 following an eight year battle with vascular dementia. Jack was born to Benjamina Gaynell Cook Ross and John Daniel Ross on June 2, 1922 in Tampa, Florida. He attended school in Tampa, graduating from Tampa College High (Jesuit High School) as a top scholar and Eagle Scout, and later, at age 19 , from Georgia Institute of Technology, with a degree in civil engineering. Following his graduation from Georgia Tech, where he was a member of Sigma Nu Fratenity, Jack studied aeronautical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology until the outbreak of World War II. He immediately entered military service in the Seabees, an engineering division of the US Navy. Jack was stationed in the Aleutian Islands, and, at the end of the war, at Opa Locka Air Station, Miami, Florida. In 1947, Jack founded the engineering firm Riley and Ross with a fellow Navy engineer. When his partner joined the Vietnam War effort, Jack agreed to stay and run the company, later acquiring a total interest and renaming the company H.J. Ross and Associates, Inc. Jack retired in 1978 and sold the company to Monenco Engineering Corporation. The company has subsequently been sold a number of times but still operates today in Miami as TYLin/H.J. Ross. His firm maintained offices in pre- Castro Cuba, Caracas, Venezuela and throughout Florida, namely in St. Petersburg, Ft. Lauderdale, Cape Canaveral, and Miami. Having designed the test facility for the Pratt/Whitney engines powering the Apollo space mission, H.J. Ross and Associates, Inc. also had a base in Huntsville, Alabama. Among the hundreds of major projects Jack's firm engineered, many are of particular note: signature hotels on Miami Beach including The Eden Roc, The Fontainebleau, The Deauville, and The Shelbourne, all Burdines department stores, the Eastern Airlines buildings at MIA, major parts of the Palmetto Expressway, dozens of facilities for Dade County Public Schools and various Marriott Hotels throughout the country. Jack had many passions: art, thoroughbred horses, history, hunting, boating, fishing and traveling, all of which he actively engaged, living life to the fullest. Jack was a long time member of Epiphany Catholic Church and a former Board Member of Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. He is predeceased by two of his daughters, Barbara Gaynelle Ross and Suzanne Mary Ross, as well as his parents and his sister, Sara Longmire. He is survived by his wife of thirty six years, Audrey Hand Jackson Ross, as well as his two daughters from his first marriage to Donna Guilfoyle Ross, Julie Ross Dunn Myers and Sally Ross Muccio (husband, Craig, and daughter, Donna), all of Miami. His is also survived by his wife's daughter, Melissa Jackson Loree, DVM (husband, Lee, and son, Oliver), of Atlanta, Georgia, as well as a number of nieces and nephews.

He will be remembered for his wit and wisdom, love of life, generosity, intelligence, and enthusiasm for learning. Above all, he loved his wife, Patricia, his children, grandchildren, and siblings. Nothing was more important to Charles than family and friends. He was a life advisor, a business advisor, and the best question asker. He had an uncanny ability to maintain deep relationships with friends from summer camp, grade school through graduate school, and beyond. For each person in his life, he remembered a birthday, a favorite moment, a funny line. He was a one-man clipping and search service, well before Google, finding what might be meaningful to each person and sending it with a hand-written note. After spending his childhood in Montgomery, AL, Charles graduated from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School (Class of '64, Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude), Harvard Business School (Class of '66), and University of Maryland Law School (Class of '79). After Harvard Business School, he went to Wall Street firm Loeb, Rhoades & Co. He moved to Baltimore in 1973 with his first wife, Jane (Shapiro) Rodbell, where he worked at United Iron & Metal (now United Holdings) with his father-in-law I.D. Shapiro. He continued to run the family office until the onset of his illness in the fall of 2015. In the mid '70s through late '90s, he was a partner at Shapiro, Robinson & Associates, advising professional athletes, including Eddie Murray, Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken Jr., Willie Mays Aikens, and Kirby Puckett. Upon moving to Baltimore, he became quickly ingrained in the city's civic and philanthropic community. He served on the boards of Center Stage, The Aaron and Lillie Straus Foundation, and the University of Maryland Foundation. In addition, he was the Investment Committee chair of the Associated Jewish Charities of Baltimore and was serving as its President at the time of his death. He was a long time member of Beth Am Synagogue. Charles' corporate board service included Baltimore's MuniMae (now MMA Capital Management), investment advisory firm Gabelli Group Capital Partners, and telecommunications company ICTC. He also served as Chairman and CEO of Morgan Group, Inc. and was a special advisor to Baltimore's Charm City Run. Charles had numerous and diverse interests including the arts, literature, sports, travel, and politics; he never missed a day or page of the Baltimore Sun, The New York Times, or Wall Street Journal. He was proud to be involved in Bill Bradley's presidential campaign and served as a Delegate to the 2000 Democratic National Convention. He enjoyed playing sports throughout his life, especially basketball, tennis, and golf, and was an avid spectator, rooting passionately for the Orioles and, above all, for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Charles is survived by his wife Patricia (Purnell) Baum of Severna Park, MD. He had three children, Andrew (1968- 1971), Katie of Berkeley, CA, and Matthew (Deborah) Baum of Baltimore, MD; and two stepdaughters, Staci (Andrew) Hodge of Baltimore and Beth Bafford (Dan Yeoman) of Washington, DC. He received endless joy from his four grandchildren, Beatrice Kennedy and Max Charles Baum and twins Samantha and Riley Hodge. He is also survived by his sister Sylvia (Herb) Horowitz of Columbia, MD and their children Joanne Beren (Jeff Arbeit), Susan Beren (Rodrigo Pizarro), David Beren, Diana England (Richard), Laura Simon (Warren); his brother John (Diane) Baum of Baltimore, MD and their children, Emily Baum (Josh Burke) and David Baum. In addition, he is survived by Jane (nee Shapiro) Rodbell (Stan) of Baltimore, MD to whom he was married from 1966-95. He was predeceased by his mother, Josephine C. Baum and father, Max S. Baum, both of Montgomery, AL. Lastly, he is survived by many friends, whom he loved and who loved him.
