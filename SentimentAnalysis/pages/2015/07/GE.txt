An intellectual with an astounding depth of knowledge of art, poetry, history, music and philosophy with a great sense of humor and a lightning quick wit, Peter was an artist, a pilot, an avid chess player and a skilled athlete, including a ranked squash player and four goal polo player. He was born in New York on July 27th, 1928, to Aviation Pioneer Chance M. Vought and his wife Ena Lewis Vought. He attended the Arizona Desert School, Deerfield Academy and Yale University. He served in the United States Navy and was stationed on the USS Yorktown. While in the Navy, he performed a successful dead stick landing at night of a crippled F9F-5 Panther fighter jet at 280 miles per hour in Alameda Island, CA. After the Navy, he studied portraiture at the Arts Student League under Edwin Dickson, and went on to study at The Academie de la Grande Chaumiere and the Academie Julien in Paris, France. In 1959, he married Barbara Schmid and moved to Aspen, CO and Santa Barbara, CA. In 1965 while living in Aspen, he co-founded the then Aspen Air Rescue with Betty Pfister while searching for NASA Dr. William Randolph Lovelace and his family. In 1978 he moved with his second wife Nan Newton to Santa Fe, NM, where he continued to paint and play polo both in the U.S. and internationally. His paintings are in both private and public collections; his work was selected to hang as a symbol of American Art in the American Embassies in Moscow and Dubai. His work is also seen in Scarves by Kolibri. Peter was predeceased by his brother Chance Vought, and his granddaughter Olivia Kuenne. He is survived by three daughters and three grandsons. His daughter Leslie Vought Kuenne and Chris Kuenne of Princeton NJ; his daughter Victoria Vought of New York, NY; his daughter Annie Vought and Scott Vermeire of Oakland, CA; his grandsons Peter, William and Matthew Kuenne; and his niece Gay Jones and his nephews Chance, John and Craig Vought.

'Ev or Evie' as her dear family and friends called her, celebrated her 95th birthday on June 7th of this year after celebrating the birth of her second great granddaughter on June 5th. Ev was born to George and Elizabeth Rapp in Elizabeth, New Jersey and grew up in Wayne along with her brothers, Chris and Bill, and sister Betty. Bill currently lives in Texas. She attended the Mountain View Grammar School and Pompton Lakes High School. After completing her training as registered nurse at Paterson General Hospital, she served during World War II, attending to returning troops. After the war she worked in the New Jersey offices of Dr. Forrest Chilton. She ultimately earned a BS in nursing. All three of her children, Andy, Doug and Laurie, were delivered by doctor Chilton at Paterson General. Ev married her high school sweetheart, Andrew Senchak on September 21st, 1941. After the war they lived in Wayne, New Jersey, Northridge, California, and Evanston, Illinois. They lived in Ocean Grove, New Jersey from 1980 until 2011. They were together for 69 years. Their marriage was marked by considerable overseas travel. Most notable was their stay in Paris where Ev studied at the Sorbonne and worked at the bookstore Shakespeare and Co. It was there that her lifelong passion for reading became partially satisfied. Evie was regarded as a gifted nurse with impressive intuition. This sensibility was also manifested in her deep, loving care for her family, friends and all members of the animal kingdom. It also found its way into her cooking, painting and writing. Her soups and salads nourished generations of neighborhood children in Wayne, Surf City, Northridge and Ocean Grove. She published a short story in the Saturday Evening Post and recently divulged her pen name after much pressure from her children. A Celebration of Life Gathering will be held from 2:30 to 3:30pm on August 25, 2015 at Attic Angel Place, 8301 Old Sauk Road, Middleton (second floor dining room). A service in Ocean Grove, New Jersey will be in September. A selection of Evie's paintings will be on display at these gatherings. Evie is survived by her brother Bill, her three children, six grandchildren, Phoebe and Christoper Banks, Alexander Case Senchak, Max Hunter Senchak, Simone Kaplan Senchak and Adrienne McKay Ranney and two great grandchildren, Ella and Nina Frankenburg. She was a cherished mother and will always be loved by Andy, Doug and Laurie.
