Helen Wetmore Brann, acclaimed literary agent, died suddenly on Monday, November 30, 2015, of complications from cancer. She was 82. Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado to Maurice Robert Brann and Alice Cynthia Wetmore. She attended The Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, CT, and graduated from Smith College in 1954. Wishing to pursue a career as a writer, she got a job as a receptionist at the New Yorker. From 1958 to 1963 she lived in England and Ireland, working as a freelance editor while writing her own novel. In 1963, she returned to New York and worked part-time for literary agent James Oliver Brown. She soon had clients of her own, among them Diane Johnson and Edmund White. In 1968, she moved to the Sterling Lord Agency. In 1974, she took a leap of faith and started The Helen Brann Agency. Eventually she shared an office with the legendary dramatic rights literary agent, Flora Roberts, where they became close friends as well as business associates. Helen moved her business to Western Connecticut in 1990 as her client list continued to grow. For decades she has represented many talented writers, including Julian Barnes, Richard Brautigan, Gerald Clarke, Nora Johnson, Daniel Yergin, Ingrid Thoft, Chuck Scarborough, Rod McKuen, Barbara Leaming, William Wright, Stephen Sondheim, Robert B. Parker and Maya Angelou. By opening her own literary agency, she became a trail blazer for women. In 2007, Helen was involved with Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign and she was pleased when being introduced to Mrs. Clinton, that Mrs. Clinton immediately recalled that Helen was the first woman to open a literary agency of her own. In October 2004, she married Faith Stewart-Gordon, artist and former owner of the Russian Tea Room in New York. They lived together in their Bridgewater home along with their many animals including goats, horses, cats and dogs. Helen owned several race horses and bred champion Norwich Terriers. Helen was a member of The Century Association, The Cosmopolitian Club, The Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club and The Hale Matthews Foundation. She co-created The Flora Roberts Award for aspiring playwrights. In addition to her spouse Faith, she is survived by her sister, Cynthia Ramsey, several nieces, nephews, great-nieces and great-nephews and Faith's daughter, Ellen Kaye and grandson, Ian Tsang. She was predeceased by her beloved sister, Beatrice. A private service will be held at a later date. Donations in Helen's memory can be made to the Palliative Care Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10065.<br><br>\n ", "keywords": []}, {"headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  JOHNSON, SALLY "}, "snippet": "JOHNSON--Sally Logemann.

In the 1960s and 70s, as Sally Logemann, Ms. Johnson was a founding member of the Waverly Consort and founder and director of the New York Renaissance Band, appearing at New York's Lincoln Center and at concert halls and music festivals worldwide. Starting as a modern oboist, Sally eventually played over a dozen instruments, including baroque oboe, shawm, recorder, dulcian, krummhorn, rackett, bells, harp and drums. She recorded extensively for Columbia, Nonesuch and Arabesque. Her groups also performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, colleges and universities throughout the US and at The White House (a Shakespeare Birthday concert in 1983). Her foreign tours included most of South America, the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico and the Medeira Bach Festival. Born Sally Ann Elizabeth Bartel in Spokane WA, August 7, 1936, Sally was a musical prodigy, winning Major Bowes Amateur Hour on piano at age five. She graduated from Roosevelt High School in Seattle WA in 1954 and was immediately hired to play oboe and English horn for two years in the Vancouver (BC) Symphony. Sally attended the University of Washington then moved to New York with her first husband Joseph Golden, principal French horn for the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, for whom he also played in the original production of West Side Story. Sally graduated from the Manhattan School of Music, then, after Joe's death from melanoma in 1960, joined the Master of Music program at New York University. There she began playing Medieval and Renaissance music, and, with fellow students, started the Waverly Consort (named for Waverly Place, site of the NYU music building). In 1972, she formed her own group, the New York Renaissance Band, with a dozen players, specializing in big-band Renaissance sound. After leaving music in the 1980s, Sally was a sales rep for United Airlines, computer specialist for CNA Insurance (she survived 9/11 in an underground vault on Wall St.) and realtor for Corcoran Group. She also sang backup for French pop outfits. Her survivors include Peter Johnson of NYC, her husband of 31 years, her son David Golden, daughter-in-law Janet Golden, and grandchildren Rebecca, Sarah and Noah Golden, all of Milford CT.
